"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was nothing short of frustrating. From the airline to the moment I arrived, the service was abysmally slow, and the staff was unhelpful. Immigration staff, in particular, were rude and disrespectful, making an already stressful experience far worse. The flight was plagued with significant delays, and constant gate changes, making the entire experience chaotic. The in-flight safety video was unprofessional and disturbing, especially for young passengers. This attempt at engagement was tasteless and unnecessary. Additionally, the constant gate changes and flight delays created confusion and anxiety throughout my entire time at the airport. Having to take a bus between terminals was highly inconvenient and only added to the frustration. What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: We hope youve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality. Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered. Given this experience, I will never fly with Malaysian Airlines or visit Malaysia again and I certainly won't be encouraging my friends or family to visit.",recent experience kuala lumpur international airport nothing short frustrate airline moment arrive service abysmally slow staff unhelpful immigration staff particular rude disrespectful make already stressful experience far worse flight plague significant delay constant gate change make entire experience chaotic inflight safety video unprofessional disturb especially young passenger attempt engagement tasteless unnecessary additionally constant gate change flight delay create confusion anxiety throughout entire time airport take bus terminal highly inconvenient add frustration really stand slogan display upon arrival hope youve enjoy malaysian hospitality frankly felt like empty promise reflection experience service speak case clear overcompensate slogan highlight gap advertise actually deliver give experience never fly malaysian airline visit malaysia certainly wont encourage friend family visit,Negative

"Ive traveled through KLIA countless times, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its due- the new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well designed, good ventilation, clean and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail spacewhy so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradisewhy isnt KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign coffe chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti? Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysias rich culinary diversity?- take a page out of Jakarta or Singapore airport. To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (Ive lost count how long Ive waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an Ask Me For Help staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone. Customer service should be better than this! KLIA, lets do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers. P.S. if youre ever at the Satellite building of KLIA terminal 1 (after the shuttle service), I highly recommend visiting the Jungle Boardwalk - a small beautiful green forest in the middle of the building I always look forward to visiting it if my Gate is located there.",ive travel countless time always impress cleanliness smooth checkin process efficient security check architecture inspire malaysian islamic natural element remain stunning highlight truly make special balance international uniquely local offering something seem fade recent klia1 renovation give credit due new bathroom huge improvement well design good ventilation clean dry retail din experience take disappointing turn many local option disappear replace foreign good alcohol tobacco seem dominate retail spacewhy much shock find one shelf malaysian food product entire terminal 1 malaysia food paradisewhy isnt celebrate instead vibrancy local flavor replace bland sameness foreign coffe chain croissant cake authentic local option would delight especially leave home crave one last nasi lemak kuey teow teh tarik curry roti traveler could enjoy authentic malaysian dish like kaya toast prawn noodle teh tarik fb scene overrun global chain like starbucks gloria jean surely good make space homegrown eatery showcase malaysias rich culinary diversity take page jakarta singapore airport add frustration monorail still service ive lose count long ive wait force traveler rely slow inefficient shuttle bus ask ask help staff member food recommendation barely look phone customer service good let good support local business bring back authentic malaysian experience traveller ps youre ever satellite building terminal 1 shuttle service highly recommend visit jungle boardwalk small beautiful green forest middle building always look forward visit gate locate,Negative

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling. This looks fancy but very old school. Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating Very confusing direction or procedure. I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products. Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority. As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go. Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there.

"Exhausting.. you need to have at least a year of airport work experience to just transit through this airport. It took nearly 2 hrs from landing to sitting down at our gate. So much is automated, and very few staff members to help, so when something goes wrong - like when the self bag-drop off machine stops working.. with one of our bags halfway through the conveyor, we were left for ages, not knowing what to do. So many more hurdles to jump such as filling in an MDAC, yes, we were asked to fill it in on-line at Siem Reap, but thought it couldn't possibly be for us as so many 'mandatory' boxes were irrelevant to us. However, at the airport, they insisted we filled it in with a bunch of false information, i.e. the address where we would be staying (had to put in an they address provided.. which was the airport's address) a waste of time, as we felt we could miss our connecting flight. We also had to create our own baggage tags, then TWO separate baggage screenings - so unnecessary. So many options of queues without clear instructions, so many people, so much walking - it just seemed chaotic. It's not my favourite airport. If we weren't so tired.. we had been travelling all day, I would have said a pretty average airport.",exhaust need least year airport work experience transit airport take nearly 2 hr land sit gate much automate staff member help something go wrong like self bagdrop machine stop work one bag halfway conveyor leave age know many hurdle jump fill mdac yes ask fill online siem reap think couldnt possibly u many mandatory box irrelevant u however airport insist fill bunch false information ie address would stay put address provide airport address waste time felt could miss connect flight also create baggage tag two separate baggage screening unnecessary many option queue without clear instruction many people much walk seem chaotic favourite airport werent tired travel day would say pretty average airport,Negative

Once youre through this gate security check, theres a waiting area with no toilets and no water. So please take care is your needs BEFORE queueing for the gate security check.

"KLIA2 is by far the most disappointing terminal, starting with the immigration service, which completely kills any desire to ever return here. Weve been to Malaysia many times, arriving through KLIA, but weve never seen such chaos. Over 300 people in line, and only 8 counters open - and working incredibly slowly! We waited in line for 1.5 (!) hours. Whats the point of filling out the online arrival form if immigration officers still spend 4-7 minutes on each tourist? After standing in line for over 1.5 hours and watching how the officers worked, we were left very disappointed. Even worse was how immigration officers treated Asian travelers with darker skin - their gestures were so disrespectful, it was truly unpleasant to witness. Ah, yes! And before departure immigration process took 30 minutes at 6:30am. A reasonable processing time at passenger-respecting airports around the world is 1520 minutes. But not at KLIA2 - here, the staff act like theyre doing you a favor by letting you enter or leave the country.

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was nothing short of frustrating. From the airline to the moment I arrived, the service was abysmally slow, and the staff was unhelpful. The immigration officers are rude and disrespectful, making an already stressful experience far worse. To be honest, it felt like the staff were completely uninterested in their job, and some even seemed to resent being there. When my family arrived at the immigration counter, the officer seemed confused when we asked whether he wanted to see our MDAC or passports first. He glanced at our passports and then repeatedly said, ""You dont look British."" When we asked why he was being rude, he flew into a rage and yelled, ""What do you mean I am being rude! Youre not welcome here. Go back to where you came from."" At first, I thought I could be overreacting, but as the situation unfolded, it made me wonder if this could be a case of racial bias, especially toward darker-skinned people. Its hard not to perceive this as racism when the treatment felt so harsh and unwarranted. But then, a white female tourist recounted her own experience, and she was visibly shaken, nearly on the verge of tears. She too had been yelled at and bullied by the Malaysian airport staff. To make matters worse, I also witnessed an Indian woman being denied entry to the bathroom just to retrieve her bag. After numerous attempts she managed to get them back. This made me realize that it wasnt just about skin colourthough it was hard not to make that connectionbut rather a broader issue with the staffs attitude toward tourist and travellers. The customer service here has drastically declined. This used to be a place where visitors were welcomed with warmth and respect, but unfortunately, thats no longer the case. Its a shame to see such a decline. In Malaysia, government jobs, including those at airports prioritize ethnic Malays over Indian and Chinese Malays. As a result, some government positions, such as immigration officers or airport staff, may be filled based on ethnicity rather than merit or qualifications. Due to this, individuals in these roles might lack the necessary qualifications or passion for the job, which can sometimes be reflected in their job performance and attitude. What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: We hope youve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality. Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered. Given this experience, I will never fly with Malaysian Airlines or visit Malaysia again and I certainly won't be encouraging my friends or family to visit. Avoid countries that do not respect and appreciate tourist coming to help their economy!",recent experience kuala lumpur international airport nothing short frustrate airline moment arrive service abysmally slow staff unhelpful immigration officer rude disrespectful make already stressful experience far bad honest felt like staff completely uninterested job even seem resent family arrive immigration counter officer seem confused ask whether want see mdac passport first glance passport repeatedly say dont look british ask rude fly rage yell mean rude youre welcome go back come first think could overreact situation unfold make wonder could case racial bias especially toward darkerskinned people hard perceive racism treatment felt harsh unwarranted white female tourist recount experience visibly shake nearly verge tear yell bully malaysian airport staff make matter bad also witness indian woman deny entry bathroom retrieve bag numerous attempt manage get back make realize wasnt skin colourthough hard make connectionbut rather broad issue staff attitude toward tourist travellers customer service drastically decline use place visitor welcome warmth respect unfortunately thats longer case shame see decline malaysia government job include airport prioritize ethnic malay indian chinese malay result government position immigration officer airport staff may fill base ethnicity rather merit qualification due individual role might lack necessary qualification passion job sometimes reflect job performance attitude really stand slogan display upon arrival hope youve enjoy malaysian hospitality frankly felt like empty promise reflection experience service speak case clear overcompensate slogan highlight gap advertise actually deliver give experience never fly malaysian airline visit malaysia certainly wont encourage friend family visit avoid country respect appreciate tourist come help economy,Negative

"Dear Airport Authority, I am writing to formally express my disappointment regarding my experience at KLIA 2 on 28 January 2025 at 3:38 AM while waiting for the departure hall to open.

However, when the hall was still closed at 3:10 AM, we asked another staff member (a Malay female), who then told us it would open at 4:00 AM. When we mentioned that her colleague had stated an earlier opening time, her response was: ""Then you ikut apa yang dia cakap lah."" When we further inquired about the actual opening time, she dismissively said: ""Then you tunggu hall buka lah."" I find this attitude highly unprofessional and unacceptable, especially for airport staff who are expected to assist passengers courteously. Providing inconsistent information and responding rudely to simple inquiries only creates confusion and frustration. I urge you to look into this matter and ensure that staff are properly trained to handle customer queries in a respectful and professional manner.

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. Oh and did I mention that the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration?

He even pressured me by asking, Do you want to catch your flight or not? This made me feel very intimidated, especially since I was traveling alone.

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers. These include clearer directional signs and more readily available information. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member to go to C15 for a transfer to the arrival hall. The signage for this transfer was unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus. Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldnt it be better to have basic international standard too? The situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall. The area was extremely crowded,people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration. Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic which leads to all these mess. After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for. The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when everyone was looking for the right belt for their luggage. Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right. We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the Singapore Airlines logo on the floor. Quite a handful of luggage was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight were still stuck in immigration. Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt. Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage much of which was in Malay. This can be rather challenging, especially after a series of such ""events"" we went through. We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter, who knows we must go through the same things going back. On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.We have to endure our thirst till our flight take off. As a tourist, I dont enjoy it if I have to go through so much hassle just to travel. Who doesnt want hassle-free travel?

"Honestly, if you are of African, Chinese, Philippines, Indian, Bengali, Nepalese, any south or south east Asian country think twice before boarding a plane to tour Malaysia or to transiting at Kula Lumpur airport.

This was specifically from a foreign worker and have verified a lot of similar cases from trip advisor. I had a friend who witnessed a group of 3-4 female Malaysian officers trying to steal the bag of an Indian girl of Aus/US/UK (can't tell the exact accent) nationality. I have also seen people get shouted and others being hit! Like what the hell! I have never seen such uncivilised behaviour at an international airport, and I have been to numerous airports across Asia and the middle east. A lot of Malaysian officers are also thieves. Be careful. I have heard of several incidents where they target individuals travelling alone, in pairs or in small groups getting pulled aside, physically hit and having money taken unlawfully from them. Though I'm not surprised. It's a Muslim majority country. Usually these people tout about honesty and peace but actually are the polar opposite rude, violent and openly steal.

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, ""because it's too late now to buy tickets"" (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid almost triple the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. And also, the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration! I had such a hard time to book the Grab taxi and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, in any airport that's when wifi is needed!! But here there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!! I've never had this much hastle and wasted time to manage to exit an airport. This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia.

"Ive traveled through KLIA countless times, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its due- the new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well designed, good ventilation, clean and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail spacewhy so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradisewhy isnt KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign caf chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti? Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysias rich culinary diversity?- take a page out of Jakarta or Singapore airport. To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (Ive lost count how long Ive waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an Ask Me For Help staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone. Customer service should be better than this! KLIA, lets do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers. P.S. if youre ever at the Satellite building of KLIA terminal 1, I highly recommend checking out the Jungle Boardwalk I always look forward to visiting it if my Gate is located there.",ive travel countless time always impress cleanliness smooth checkin process efficient security check architecture inspire malaysian islamic natural element remain stunning highlight truly make special balance international uniquely local offering something seem fade recent klia1 renovation give credit due new bathroom huge improvement well design good ventilation clean dry retail din experience take disappointing turn many local option disappear replace foreign good alcohol tobacco seem dominate retail spacewhy much shock find one shelf malaysian food product entire terminal 1 malaysia food paradisewhy isnt celebrate instead vibrancy local flavor replace bland sameness foreign caf chain croissant cake authentic local option would delight especially leave home crave one last nasi lemak kuey teow teh tarik curry roti traveler could enjoy authentic malaysian dish like kaya toast prawn noodle teh tarik fb scene overrun global chain like starbucks gloria jean surely good make space homegrown eatery showcase malaysias rich culinary diversity take page jakarta singapore airport add frustration monorail still service ive lose count long ive wait force traveler rely slow inefficient shuttle bus ask ask help staff member food recommendation barely look phone customer service good let good support local business bring back authentic malaysian experience traveller ps youre ever satellite building terminal 1 highly recommend check jungle boardwalk always look forward visit gate locate,Negative

"One of the worst airports I've ever been to. The staff is incredibly nonchalant, more busy checking their phones than helping passengers in difficulty. We arrived 30 minutes before boarding, but the agent at the counter categorically refused to let us through. He didn't even bother to call the gate to let us know we were there or try to find a solution. I know you have to arrive 1 hour before check-in and 30 minutes before boarding, but this was truly exceptional. Background: Our first flight (with Air Asia) was delayed by 1 hour, which left us only 45 minutes to check in for our second flight (with Malaysia Airlines). And in those 45 minutes, we had to: exit immigration, fill out immigration paperwork, take a taxi (because the train between the terminals was closed), go through customs again in the other terminal, and then take another bus to get to the plane, which is impossible to do in 45 minutes. Changing terminals was a real nightmare: the train connecting the terminals was out of service, so we had to retrace our steps to catch a taxi, which we had to pay for ourselves at a reception deskwhere, once again, the staff seemed more engrossed in their phones than in their work. After the first agent refused, we tried our luck at another check-in kiosk (using a machine); other people were there. We explained the situation, and to get through, we had to lie by saying that ""the man at the counter had given us the green light."" At that point, we were let through. Immigration and customs literally told us to run! But when we arrived at the boarding gate, just a minute before departure, they categorically refused to let us board. The staff were there, on their phones, with no desire to help. One woman even pretended to call someone to tell us that ""it's over, the doors are closed,"" before literally turning her back on us. All this because of a delay by one of their partner airlines, and there was no flexibility, no consideration. The result: we had to buy new tickets, this time with Emirates. And there, however, nothing to complain abouttop-notch welcome, professional service.",one bad airport ive ever staff incredibly nonchalant busy check phone help passenger difficulty arrive 30 minute board agent counter categorically refuse let u didnt even bother call gate let u know try find solution know arrive 1 hour checkin 30 minute board truly exceptional background first flight air asia delay 1 hour leave u 45 minute check second flight malaysia airline 45 minute exit immigration fill immigration paperwork take taxi train terminal close go custom terminal take another bus get plane impossible 45 minute change terminal real nightmare train connect terminal service retrace step catch taxi pay reception deskwhere staff seem engrossed phone work first agent refuse try luck another checkin kiosk use machine people explain situation get lie say man counter give u green light point let immigration custom literally tell u run arrive board gate minute departure categorically refuse let u board staff phone desire help one woman even pretend call someone tell u door close literally turn back u delay one partner airline flexibility consideration result buy new ticket time emirate however nothing complain abouttopnotch welcome professional service,Negative

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers. - These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member..standing at the side, to go to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall. - Wouldn't it be better to put up clear large signage at both sides of the walkway while we disembarked? - Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. The signage for this bus transfer was also unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus. Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldnt it be better to have a basic international standard too? Not sure if the timing we arrived is a peak season but that day itself,the no.of passengers is not a joke. The situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall. The area was extremely crowded, and people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration. Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to manage the human traffic, which leads to all these mess. Good thing is the officer trying their level best to clear the queue. After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was another challenge. The area was so crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you are required to walk near the belt to check on the monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for. The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when there are different groups of people surrounding the area....some was like lost souls looking for directions, while some gather in between the way waiting for their friends, and you have those looking up and low for the right belt for their luggage. We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the SQ Airlines logo on the floor. There was quite a handful of luggage that was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight as us were still stuck in immigration. Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt.... This can be rather challenging, especially after coming a long ""way"" out from immigration Thought we are only required to transit to the arrival hall as a 1 time off thingy. Who knows, we must go through the same things even for departure. On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient. We have to endure our thirst till our flight takes off. As a tourist, the airport gives the 1st impression for passengers and how they are organized. Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.",write provide feedback recent experience fly via singapore airline generally appreciate quality service singapore airline flight disappoint airport experience especially consider budget flight although airport large pack many shop eatery area could improve facilitate smooth transit arrive passenger include clear directional sign large screen readily available information upon arrival disembark plane direct staff memberstanding side go cxx transfer arrival hall wouldnt good put clear large signage side walkway disembark would also suggest consider adjust volume announcement speaker loud clear information english chinese malay signage bus transfer also unclear take u find area queue feeder bus since airport name international airport wouldnt good basic international standard sure timing arrive peak season day itselfthe noof passenger joke situation worsen upon arrival arrival hall area extremely crowded people queue 2 3 line rowresulting queue hour clear immigration disorganized messy one manage human traffic lead mess good thing officer try level best clear queue clear immigration locate correct baggage belt another challenge area crowded three four luggage belt require walk near belt check monitor screen show flight belt mean screen flash fast many people try catch glimpse information rather frustrate especially different group people surround areasome like lose soul look direction gather way wait friend look low right belt luggage find luggage outside luggage belt area sign sq airline logo floor quite handful luggage locate obviously take flight u still stick immigration imagine time take moment disembark plane get luggage leave outside belt rather challenge especially come long way immigration think require transit arrival hall 1 time thingy know must go thing even departure return flight require take short bus departure hall furthermore water dispenser available pass inspection gate inconvenient endure thirst till flight take tourist airport give 1st impression passenger organize hope feedback take consideration future improvement,Negative

"Exhausting.. you need to have at least a year of airport work experience to just transit through this airport. It took nearly 2 hrs from landing to sitting down at our gate. So much is automated, and very few staff members to help, so when something goes wrong - like when the self bag-drop off machine stops working.. with one of our bags halfway through the conveyor, we were left for ages, not knowing what to do. So many more hurdles to jump such as filling in an MDAC, yes, we were asked to fill it in on-line at Siem Reap, but thought it couldn't possibly be for us as so many 'mandatory' boxes were irrelevant to us. However, at the airport, they insisted we filled it in with a bunch of false information, i.e. the address where we would be staying (had to put in an address that they provided.. which was the airport's address) a waste of time, as we felt we could miss our connecting flight. We also had to create our own baggage tags, then TWO separate baggage screenings - so unnecessary. There are so many options of queues without clear instructions, so many people, so much walking - it just seemed chaotic. It's not my favourite airport. If we weren't so tired.. we had been travelling all day, I would have said a pretty average airport.",exhaust need least year airport work experience transit airport take nearly 2 hr land sit gate much automate staff member help something go wrong like self bagdrop machine stop work one bag halfway conveyor leave age know many hurdle jump fill mdac yes ask fill online siem reap think couldnt possibly u many mandatory box irrelevant u however airport insist fill bunch false information ie address would stay put address provide airport address waste time felt could miss connect flight also create baggage tag two separate baggage screening unnecessary many option queue without clear instruction many people much walk seem chaotic favourite airport werent tired travel day would say pretty average airport,Negative

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was unfortunately extremely disappointing. Firstly, the staff were generally unfriendly and appeared to have minimal understanding of English, which made basic communication difficult to impossible. More critically, there was a noticeable general incompetence across various functions. Staff seemed unable or unwilling to perform their duties, such as overseeing passengers and maintaining order in the queues. An additional major point of inefficiency was the self-service process: I was directed to the scanner by immigration staff, only for the scanner to then instruct me to return to the immigration counter, causing further unnecessary delays and frustration. I repeatedly observed an absolute lack of professional supervision, where people were simply allowed to cut in line or where queues dissolved into chaos without any staff intervention. This combination of poor (and by times even disrespectful) customer service, language barriers, and failure to enforce basic operational procedures led to unnecessary stress and delays. It's clear that KLIA urgently needs to invest in significantly better training for its personnel, focusing on customer service, language proficiency, and core job efficiency.

"I recently traveled to Malaysia with my family, including young children, and was extremely disappointed by the poor management at the airport upon our arrival. After our plane landed, we had to wait for two full hours just to get through immigration. The lines were incredibly long, and there were no clear directions, very few staff members to assist, and an overall lack of organization in managing the arriving passengers. My children and elderly family members were forced to stand the entire time, which was both exhausting and unacceptable after a long flight. I expected better from a major international airport. There was no prioritization for families with children, no proper communication, and very little effort to speed up the process. It felt like the airport was completely unprepared to handle the volume of passengers arriving. My advice to the airport management: Please improve the arrival process by increasing staff at immigration counters, organizing separate queues for families, and providing clearer signage and communication. Travelers come to Malaysia expecting hospitality and efficiency unfortunately, this experience was neither welcoming nor efficient.

So you ultimately have counters that are over capacity cause they have implemented a e-gate system that doesn't work and a set of counters that have staff and no users cause they don't have the right ""boarding pass"".

"KLIA1 Renovation: A Step Forward, But Wheres the Local Charm? Ive traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its duethe new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well-designed, clean, and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail spacewhy so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradisewhy isnt KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign caf chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti? Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysias rich culinary diversity? To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (Ive lost count how long Ive waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an Ask Me For Help staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone. Customer service should be better than this! KLIA, lets do better!

"The airport is modern, spacious, and generally well-run. However, there were a few moments of confusion worth mentioning. Upon arrival, the immigration process was not clearly marked. Passengers with Malaysian passports go through a different gate than those with foreign passports, but the signage didnt make that obvious. Additionally, all international visitors must fill out a digital arrival form about their stay. There were enough computers available to do this at the airport, but the form isnt very intuitive, and it requires knowing the exact address of your accommodation. It could definitely be made more user-friendly. The departure experience was quick, smooth, and without queues. However, just before boarding the plane, there was a second bag check, and surprisingly, you couldnt bring any drinks on board not even those in your own bottles or purchased in the terminal. Only drinks sealed in security bags by the shop were allowed, and not all stores offer this option. Unfortunately, no one informed us of this at the time of purchase, which was frustrating and once again showed a lack of clear communication.",airport modern spacious generally wellrun however moment confusion worth mention upon arrival immigration process clearly marked passenger malaysian passport go different gate foreign passport signage didnt make obvious additionally international visitor must fill digital arrival form stay enough computer available airport form isnt intuitive require know exact address accommodation could definitely make userfriendly departure experience quick smooth without queue however board plane second bag check surprisingly couldnt bring drink board even bottle purchase terminal drink seal security bag shop allow store offer option unfortunately one inform u time purchase frustrate show lack clear communication,Negative

And when I tried to suggest politely to the worker there to tell her manager to improve the system, so old people and pregnant women can get the seat in advance, the security guy came to ask what was my passport (as a sign of threat - yet smoothly) 2.

I asked multiple staff members for help with basic info, and every single one just shrugged, said ""I don't know"" and acted like it wasn't their job. There was zero effort to even try and find out. It's truly baffling. Then there's the internal airport bus with no proper monitoring. We had our 5-month-old with us and we literally had to stand for a 5-minute ride between gates. The bus wasn't even packed but everyone was too busy hogging their spot to offer one up to someone struggling with a baby. The fear of losing balance and dropping our infant was terrifying. People just sat there watching us, completely uncaring. To top it off, we saw a couple of electric buggies nearby, clearly for passenger assistance, but there was no one to drive them! We asked four different staff if they could help us get one, and each time, we got the same clueless ""I don't know"" response. For an international airport, the lack of basic help and common courtesy is really poor. Traveling with a baby is already tough enough, and KLIA just made it worse. I'll definitely be trying to avoid this airport next time.",second trip kuala lumpur international airport unfortunately frustrating first customer service huge problem ask multiple staff member help basic info every single one shrug say dont know act like wasnt job zero effort even try find truly baffle theres internal airport bus proper monitoring 5monthold u literally stand 5minute ride gate bus wasnt even pack everyone busy hog spot offer one someone struggle baby fear lose balance drop infant terrify people sit watch u completely uncaring top saw couple electric buggy nearby clearly passenger assistance one drive ask four different staff could help u get one time get clueless dont know response international airport lack basic help common courtesy really poor travel baby already tough enough make bad ill definitely try avoid airport next time,Negative

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was nothing short of frustrating. The immigration officers are rude and disrespectful, making an already stressful experience far worse. To be honest, it felt like the staff were completely uninterested in their job, and some even seemed to resent being there. In Malaysia, government jobs, including those at airports prioritize ethnic Malays over Indian and Chinese Malays. As a result, some government positions, such as immigration officers or airport staff, may be filled based on ethnicity rather than merit or qualifications. Due to this, individuals in these roles might lack the necessary qualifications or passion for the job, which can sometimes be reflected in their job performance and attitude. What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: We hope youve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality. Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered. Given this experience, I will never fly with Malaysian Airlines or visit Malaysia again and I certainly won't be encouraging my friends or family to visit.

When I asked why, he completely ignored me. It felt discriminatory and unprofessional. Immigration was a nightmare: 75 minutes in line just for slow biometric checks, while our luggage was left unattended off the belt. On the return back home, an immigration officer told us our family was too big and refused to process all six passports, forcing us to split up. I have never seen such behavior in any international airport. Most Immigration officers were too rude. To make things worse: Batik Air check-in staff were rude and lied about baggage weight, and duty-free prices were ridiculously overpriced (almost 3x more than outside).

Strict baggage control, but not consistent: My hand luggage was accurately weighed, and even though it was only slightly over 6kg, I was told to pay extra. At the same time, the Malaysian woman in front of me, weighing almost 8 kg, was allowed to walk away - that felt unfair. 2. Poor Signage: Some gates had no numbers, which was extremely confusing. It was difficult to find the right path. 3. Lack of seating: There were no seats at the gate, which made the wait unnecessarily tiring. 4. Inadequate Toilets: The women's restrooms were a mess - I waited in line for over 30 minutes and when it was finally my turn, they were dirty.

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers. - These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member..standing at the side, to go to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall. Rather than having a staff member saying out to those passengers embarking, there might be a chance people will miss that important message. - Wouldn't it be better to put up clear large signage at both sides of the walkway while we disembarked? - Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. The signage for this bus transfer was also unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus. Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldnt it be better to have a basic international standard too? The situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall. The area was extremely crowded, and people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration. Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic, which leads to all these mess. After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for. The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when there are different groups of people surrounding the area....some was like lost souls looking for directions, while some gather in between the way waiting for their friends, and you have those looking up and low for the right belt for their luggage. Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right. We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the SQ Airlines logo on the floor. There was quite a handful of luggage that was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight as us were still stuck in immigration. Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt.... Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage, much of which was in Malay. This can be rather challenging, especially after coming a long ""way"" out from immigration We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter. Who knows, we must go through the same things going back. On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient. We have to endure our thirst till our flight takes off. As a tourist, the airport gives the 1st impression for passengers and how they are organized. This wasn't the kind of experience I was expecting from KLIA. Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.",write provide feedback recent experience fly via singapore airline generally appreciate quality service singapore airline flight disappoint airport experience especially consider budget flight although airport large pack many shop eatery area could improve facilitate smooth transit arrive passenger include clear directional sign large screen readily available information upon arrival disembark plane direct staff memberstanding side go cxx transfer arrival hall rather staff member say passenger embark might chance people miss important message wouldnt good put clear large signage side walkway disembark would also suggest consider adjust volume announcement speaker loud clear information english chinese malay signage bus transfer also unclear take u find area queue feeder bus since airport name international airport wouldnt good basic international standard situation worsen upon arrival arrival hall area extremely crowded people queue 2 3 line rowresulting queue hour clear immigration disorganized messy one direct human traffic lead mess clear immigration locate correct baggage belt challenge area crowd three four luggage belt need walk near belt check mediumsized monitor screen show flight belt mean screen flash fast many people try catch glimpse information rather frustrate especially different group people surround areasome like lose soul look direction gather way wait friend look low right belt luggage literally many passenger visibly struggle find luggage move leave right find luggage outside luggage belt area sign sq airline logo floor quite handful luggage locate obviously take flight u still stick immigration imagine time take moment disembark plane get luggage leave outside belt navigate airport area find grab also confuse due signage much malay rather challenge especially come long way immigration think maybe common arrival passenger encounter know must go thing go back return flight require take short bus departure hall furthermore water dispenser available pass inspection gate inconvenient endure thirst till flight take tourist airport give 1st impression passenger organize wasnt kind experience expect hope feedback take consideration future improvement,Negative

The ground staff were uncooperative and extremely slow it took me 45 minutes just to drop my luggage, which is unacceptable for a major international airport.

Officers were more engaged in chatting among themselves than assisting travelers. When it came to the facial recognition scan, there was no clear instruction on when to stop looking into the camera, leading to confusion and further hold-ups. Such negligence and poor communication from immigration staff are not what you'd expect from a facility that aims to be a gateway to the country. Overall, KLIA seriously needs to step up its service standards. Staff training, efficiency, and customer interaction must be improved if the airport wants to compete with other major international hubs.

"We landed from Langkawi and had a transfer to the international terminal to catch a flight to Singapore. Everything was ok until we had to find Gate H in the international terminal!

The moment we were in the international terminal, we followed signs to Gare H then suddenly the signage changed to A,B,C.H so we followed that. Then after walking for sometime, we had to take a bus! And the bus brought us back to where we started! Needless to say, we missed our flight. Ground staffs had no knowledge on what to do next! We were walking aimlessly and each time we passed the same way, we had to scan our hand carry! Thank God we found the transfer counter in the end! This airport is a nightmare!

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through a mall to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 PM, which was also the listed departure time, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia.",airport make never want come back malaysia design place first walk plane immigration baggage claim unbelievably long ive travel many large airport ive never walk much reach luggage could overlook come next even bad collect bag pass immigration force walk mall get exit yes literal mall every airport world youd check transportation finally leave long flight last thing anyone want drag maze store leave airport felt like cash grab travel hub finally make relieve see grab available use thailand book ride wait time 35 minute huge overcrowded grab wait area screen show incoming car plate clearly demand way beyond airport could handle tired frustrate give grab hop catch bus instead werent allow buy ticket exactly 12 pm also list departure time late buy ticket 15 minute ahead tell bus would leave even 12 whole thing felt disorganized unclear wait time seem grab destination station even close hotel end pay double grab fare take regular taxi get hell airport logistical mess terrible first impression malaysia,Negative

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member, who was shouting, to proceed to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall. Was thinking that perhaps our flight was scheduled to park in a further lot due to multiple flights arriving around the same time. Personally, I wasnt expecting to go through the hassle of having to transit from the plane to the arrival hall, taking into consideration that this was a direct flight. Anyway, still went with the flow and follow those in front since we are told to.... This information could easily be missed if people are talking or focused on finding the nearest toilet. Although the airport was large and packed with lots of shops and eateries, there are areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving/departure passengers. Would suggest the following improvements: * Rather than having a staff member shouting/giving instructions, can consider placing clear, large signage on both sides of the walkway as passengers disembark. * Provide more readily available information upon flight arrival / departure. * Consider adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Clear directional signs and information would make a big difference for first-time visitors like myself and would save a lot of time especially when there are so many incoming/outgoing flights day to day..... The signage for the bus transfer was unclear, and it took approximately 4-5 minutes to find the waiting point to queue for the feeder bus to the arrival hall. Upon arriving at the arrival hall, it was another 2-minute walk to reach immigration. The area was extremely crowded, with queues of 2-3 lines in a row, resulting in an hour-long wait to clear immigration. The process was very disorganized and messy, with no one managing the human traffic, possibly due to a shortage of manpower. Although the officers were friendly and efficient in clearing the queue, it would be beneficial to have crowd control/security to guide and manage the flow of passengers. Locating the correct baggage belt after clearing immigration was another challenge. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts, requiring passengers to walk near the belt to check the monitor screen. This was frustrating, especially with different groups of people surrounding the area, some looking for directions, some waiting for friends, and others searching for the right belt. We eventually found our luggage placed not far away from the luggage belt area near the exit, with a sign displaying the SQ Airlines logo on the floor. Many unclaimed bags from our flight were present, as most passengers were still stuck in immigration. The entire process, from disembarking the plane to retrieving our luggage outside the baggage claim area, was challenging. I thought we were only required to transit to the arrival hall as a one-time occurrence. However, on our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient. As a tourist, the airport gives the first impression for passengers, and its organization is crucial.

Each level has two separate sides, and if you accidentally end up on the wrong one, you have to go back up and re-enter from another point theres no direct way to cross over. The terminals are connected by trains, but shockingly, youre charged 2 MYR per person just to use them! Shuttle buses are available, but only from specific areas that take at least 30 minutes of walking to reach, with no clear guidance. There are no proper information desks, and youre left to ask random staff who often give vague or conflicting directions. To make matters worse, baggage trolley staff were communicating using loud whistles it was chaotic and very unpleasant. The AirAsia terminal (2) was particularly bad and felt extremely disorganized. This experience alone is enough to make me reconsider visiting Malaysia again just to avoid going through this airport.",one bad airport experience ive ever airport spacious design extremely confusing level two separate side accidentally end wrong one go back reenter another point theres direct way cross terminal connect train shockingly youre charge 2 myr per person use shuttle bus available specific area take least 30 minute walk reach clear guidance proper information desk youre leave ask random staff often give vague conflict direction make matter bad baggage trolley staff communicate use loud whistle chaotic unpleasant airasia terminal 2 particularly bad felt extremely disorganize experience alone enough make reconsider visit malaysia avoid go airport,Negative

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers. These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member to go to C15 for a transfer to the arrival hall. Rather having a staff to shout ,wouldn't it be better to put up clear large signage at both side of the walk way while we disembark? The signage for this bus transfer was also unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus. Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldnt it be better to have basic international standard too? Situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall. The area was extremely crowded,people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration. Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic which leads to all these mess. After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for. The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when yiu have different groups of people surrounding the area....some was waiting for their friends while some was was looking for the right belt for their luggage. Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right. We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the Singapore Airlines logo on the floor. Quite a handful of luggage was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight were still stuck in immigration. Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt. Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage much of which was in Malay. This can be rather challenging, especially after a series of such ""events"" we went through. We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter, who knows we must go through the same things going back. On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.We have to endure our thirst till our flight take off. As a tourist, I dont enjoy it if I have to go through so much hassle. This was one of a kind of experience i wasn't expecting from KLIA... Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.",write provide feedback recent experience fly via singapore airline generally appreciate quality service singapore airline flight disappoint airport experience especially consider budget flight although airport large pack many shop eatery area could improve facilitate smooth transit arrive passenger include clear directional sign large screen readily available information upon arrival disembark plane direct staff member go c15 transfer arrival hall rather staff shout wouldnt good put clear large signage side walk way disembark signage bus transfer also unclear take u find area queue feeder bus would also suggest consider adjust volume announcement speaker loud clear information english chinese malay since airport name international airport wouldnt good basic international standard situation worsen upon arrival arrival hall area extremely crowdedpeople queue 2 3 line rowresulting queue hour clear immigration disorganized messy one direct human traffic lead mess clear immigration locate correct baggage belt challenge area crowd three four luggage belt need walk near belt check mediumsized monitor screen show flight belt mean screen flash fast many people try catch glimpse information rather frustrate especially yiu different group people surround areasome wait friend look right belt luggage literally many passenger visibly struggle find luggage move leave right find luggage outside luggage belt area sign singapore airline logo floor quite handful luggage locate obviously take flight still stick immigration imagine time take moment disembark plane get luggage leave outside belt navigate airport area find grab also confuse due signage much malay rather challenge especially series event go think maybe common arrival passenger encounter know must go thing go back return flight require take short bus departure hall furthermore water dispenser available pass inspection gate inconvenientwe endure thirst till flight take tourist dont enjoy go much hassle one kind experience wasnt expect hope feedback take consideration future improvement,Negative

At the boarding gates, it's stifling, crowded together on dirty seats. People are outrageous and unruly. The restrooms are okay.

"The airport looks very fancy and all - at least Terminal 1. It is very unorganized though. We arrived extremely late from our first flight (thank you batik air) and only had 15-20min items to get our connecting flight. Normally airports would provide a shuttle services, picking you from a gate to bring you to your connecting flight in time. This was not the case here, we were only told the gate number of our connecting flight, which after running to for 10min, turned out to be the wrong gate. So instead we had to take the bus to another terminal, which obviously did not give us enough time to catch our flight, so we were stuck in KL for 1 night. Additionally it is ridiculous, that there is no smoking area in the entirety of terminal 1. So if you are stuck here for a while you have to go all the way to terminal 2, into one of the most disgusting smoking rooms Ive witnessed in my life (no ventilation at all, might as well just walk in and breath twice and youve already passively smoked a carton of cigarettes). Really disappointing for such a modern (only t1) and large airport.",airport look fancy least terminal 1 unorganized though arrive extremely late first flight thank batik air 1520min item get connect flight normally airport would provide shuttle service pick gate bring connect flight time case tell gate number connect flight run 10min turn wrong gate instead take bus another terminal obviously give u enough time catch flight stick kl 1 night additionally ridiculous smoke area entirety terminal 1 stick go way terminal 2 one disgusting smoking room ive witness life ventilation might well walk breath twice youve already passively smoke carton cigarette really disappoint modern t1 large airport,Negative

"Arriving: Immigration for arrivals took too long! The officers works so slowly and the poor internet connection in this area is not helping either. It took us long enough to complete immigration to the point that our bags were no longer in the conveyor belt/shown on screen. Pick up location of ride hailing (Grab) was easy at Level 1. Departure: Check in counters are spread out making it not too crowded/congested. Immigration for departure is quicker and easier. However, there's a security screening for customs departure that was separated with at-gate security check. I would say this is very inefficient as you need to check your bags twice and once you have cleared security you practically cannot go out to the retail area. In addition, the post-security gate is a nightmare with neither water stations nor proper toilet! There seems to be no signs of priority boarding based on group but rather by seats (not sure if this is an MH or KLIA problem). Retail space is decent with great tax-free goods options and decent restaurant selections. One thing to appreciate: the toilets (in retail & public) areas are clean and equipped with jet showers.",arrive immigration arrival take long officer work slowly poor internet connection area help either take u long enough complete immigration point bag longer conveyor beltshown screen pick location ride hail grab easy level 1 departure check counter spread make crowdedcongested immigration departure quick easy however theres security screening custom departure separate atgate security check would say inefficient need check bag twice clear security practically go retail area addition postsecurity gate nightmare neither water station proper toilet seem sign priority board base group rather seat sure mh problem retail space decent great taxfree good option decent restaurant selection one thing appreciate toilet retail public area clean equip jet shower,Negative

"I was assaulted by a female airport customer experience officer who attempted to physically restrain me without justification. When I demanded to file a police report, I was told I would have to go to Terminal 2something my Australian emergency passport did not permit. Despite my repeated requests, the airport police refused to take my report and instead escorted me to the immigration department. There, I was met by an aggressive and unprofessional immigration officer named Kamarudin. When I asked for his full name in writing, he refused and rudely pointed to his name badge, telling me to take a photo with my phone.

Case precedent (PP v. Mohd Anuar bin Abdullah [1994] 2 MLJ 261) confirms that any intentional use of force without lawful justification meets this threshold. 2. **Wrongful Confinement (Penal Code Section 340)** The unlawful restriction of my movement within the clinic treatment room amounts to wrongful confinement. Malaysian jurisprudence establishes that detention without legal authority is punishable, particularly where no legitimate lien exists over the person. 3. **Official Misconduct** The behavior of Immigration Officer Kamarudin in: - Failing to properly address a criminal complaint - Intimidating a complainant - Improper use of personal devices to photograph sensitive documents May constitute offenses under Malaysia's official misconduct provisions.

"What happened to KLIA? I loved this airport. It was clean, friendly, quick and easy to get through. But the past few times it was horrible: long lines, unfriendly and unhelpful staff, angry travelers, expensive food (yes, more expensive) and more. Toilets are overal dirty too. Travelers are also unfriendly and loud. Not KLIAs fault, but nobody seems to care. Cellphones everywhere playing all kind of videos, loud phone calls, and playing music that's just horrible. The rain forest thing seems a joke to me. Nice idea, but its advertised as if its huge. It's not, its small. Nice view through a window inside it, because it was closed and I have no idea if its normally open to enter. When I went through security it felt to easy, and it was. It seems gates have a second security point. No clear lines, no communication, and everyone is pushing and pulling to get through. Staff dont seem to care. I almost missed my flight because there were 4 lines for 1 gate and nobody knew who could go through. Add some clear lines or something. Two positive things: arriving is pretty simple and quick.

There are no proper information desks, and youre left to ask random staff who often give vague or conflicting directions.

Not even worth one star. The moment you enter the country youll get scolded by the immigration for coming to the counter together with your partner even though there are plenty of people do the same in other counters. So if you get a shitty officer they will ruin your trip. I faced this with a lady at the immigration who was extremely moody early morning. Without any hesitation she vented it on the tourists. Imagine you get screamed at once you land in the country that you are going to spend your money in! The worst airport Ive ever been to out of so many countries Ive travelled to.

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, ""because it's too late now to buy tickets"" (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid almost triple the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. And also, the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration! I had such a hard time to book the Grab taxi and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, in any airport that's when wifi is needed!! But here there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!! I've never had this much hastle and wasted time to manage to exit an airport, oh yeah, and the airport is so far away from the city it took us 90 minutes to reach the hotel (with zero traffic after midnight) knowing this, the designers still decided to add a mall to make your trip even slower!

"Extremely Poor Experience with Malaysia Airlines and Airport Authority Ive been standing in queue for over 2 hours, and the situation is completely mismanaged.

This caused the backlog and queues again!!!! One of the worst airport experiences in my life. Unprofessional and slow employees, poor airport management and organization.

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was shockingly poor and has completely soured my view of Malaysia. Arriving late at night, I was met with an appalling three-hour wait in the immigration queue. With only two counters open, the already tired and frustrated passengers were subjected to rude and unprofessional behavior from the immigration officers. One officer, who identified himself as Nizam, was particularly aggressive, yelling at passengers and making demeaning comments about their attempts to use the biometric scanners. His dismissive attitude and condescending tone were echoed by other staff members, creating a hostile and uncomfortable atmosphere for everyone, including families with young children. The situation worsened when, due to the extensive delay, our luggage was removed from the baggage carousel. This added further stress and inconvenience to an already exhausting experience. It felt as though the immigration staff treated their positions as some sort of celebrity status, rather than a service role. The impact of this disastrous airport experience rippled through my entire trip. I had to cancel some planned tourist attractions due to the excessive wait times I encountered elsewhere, including another two-hour queue. My children were exhausted, and our holiday was ultimately ruined. As if the airport ordeal wasn't enough, our tourist vehicle was later stopped by police for a seemingly pointless immigration check, resulting in another hour-long delay. This unnecessary display of authority felt like a final insult. It's ironic that Malaysia's economy relies heavily on tourism, yet visitors are treated with such disrespect. This entire experience was so negative that I will never visit Malaysia again. It's truly a shame, as I had hoped for a much more positive experience.",recent experience kuala lumpur international airport shockingly poor completely sour view malaysia arrive late night meet appal threehour wait immigration queue two counter open already tire frustrate passenger subject rude unprofessional behavior immigration officer one officer identify nizam particularly aggressive yelling passenger make demeaning comment attempt use biometric scanners dismissive attitude condescend tone echo staff member create hostile uncomfortable atmosphere everyone include family young child situation worsen due extensive delay luggage remove baggage carousel add stress inconvenience already exhaust experience felt though immigration staff treat position sort celebrity status rather service role impact disastrous airport experience ripple entire trip cancel plan tourist attraction due excessive wait time encounter elsewhere include another twohour queue child exhaust holiday ultimately ruin airport ordeal wasnt enough tourist vehicle later stop police seemingly pointless immigration check result another hourlong delay unnecessary display authority felt like final insult ironic malaysias economy rely heavily tourism yet visitor treat disrespect entire experience negative never visit malaysia truly shame hop much positive experience,Negative

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers. These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member to go to C15 for a transfer to the arrival hall. Rather having a staff to shout ,wouldn't it be better to put up clear signage at both side of the walk way while we disembark? The signage for this bus transfer was unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus. Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldnt it be better to have basic international standard too? Situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall. The area was extremely crowded,people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration. Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic which leads to all these mess. After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for. The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when yiu have different groups of people surrounding the area....some was waiting for their friends while some was was looking for the right belt for their luggage. Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right. We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the Singapore Airlines logo on the floor. Quite a handful of luggage was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight were still stuck in immigration. Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt. Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage much of which was in Malay. This can be rather challenging, especially after a series of such ""events"" we went through. We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter, who knows we must go through the same things going back. On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall.

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling. This looks fancy but very old school. Restaurant not enough air con at night time.

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was unfortunately extremely disappointing. Firstly, the staff were generally unfriendly and appeared to have minimal understanding of English, which made basic communication difficult to impossible. More critically, there was a noticeable general incompetence across various functions. Staff seemed unable or unwilling to perform their duties, such as overseeing passengers and maintaining order in the queues. In this context, I repeatedly observed an absolute lack of professional supervision, where people were simply allowed to cut in line or where queues dissolved into chaos without any staff intervention. An additional major point of inefficiency was the self-service process: I was directed to the scanner by immigration staff, only for the scanner to then instruct me to return to the immigration counter, causing further unnecessary delays and frustration. Furthermore, the signage (wayfinding) was poor, often unclear, and lacked sufficient repetition throughout the terminal, making navigation difficult. To top it all off, there was also a lack of seating at the airport itself, and the seats that were available were often taken up by a single person lying down across three seats, leaving people who wanted to sit with nowhere to go. This combination of poor (and by times even disrespectful) customer service, language barriers, failure to enforce basic operational procedures and the lack of seating led to unnecessary stress and delays. It's clear that KLIA urgently needs to invest in significantly better training for its personnel, focusing on customer service, language proficiency, and core job efficiency. If I could give 0 stars, I would!",recent experience kuala lumpur international airport unfortunately extremely disappointing firstly staff generally unfriendly appear minimal understanding english make basic communication difficult impossible critically noticeable general incompetence across various function staff seem unable unwilling perform duty oversee passenger maintain order queue context repeatedly observe absolute lack professional supervision people simply allow cut line queue dissolve chaos without staff intervention additional major point inefficiency selfservice process direct scanner immigration staff scanner instruct return immigration counter cause unnecessary delay frustration furthermore signage wayfinding poor often unclear lack sufficient repetition throughout terminal making navigation difficult top also lack seat airport seat available often take single person lie across three seat leave people want sit nowhere go combination poor time even disrespectful customer service language barrier failure enforce basic operational procedure lack seat lead unnecessary stress delay clear urgently need invest significantly good training personnel focus customer service language proficiency core job efficiency could give 0 star would,Negative

I asked multiple staff members for help with basic info, and every single one just shrugged, said ""I don't know"" and acted like it wasn't their job. There was zero effort to even try and find out. It's truly baffling. Then there's the internal airport bus with no proper monitoring. We had our 5-month-old with us and we literally had to stand for a 5-minute ride between gates. The bus wasn't even packed but everyone was too busy hogging their spot to offer one up to someone struggling with a baby. The fear of losing balance and dropping our infant was terrifying. People just sat there watching us, completely uncaring. To top it off, we saw a couple of electric buggies nearby, clearly for passenger assistance, but there was no one to drive them! We asked four different staff if they could help us get one, and each time, we got the same clueless ""I don't know"" response. For an international airport, the lack of basic help and common courtesy is really poor. Traveling with a baby is already tough enough, and KLIA just made it worse.

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through a mall to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 PM, which was also the listed departure time, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia.",airport make never want come back malaysia design place first walk plane immigration baggage claim unbelievably long ive travel many large airport ive never walk much reach luggage could overlook come next even bad collect bag pass immigration force walk mall get exit yes literal mall every airport world youd check transportation finally leave long flight last thing anyone want drag maze store leave airport felt like cash grab travel hub finally make relieve see grab available use thailand book ride wait time 35 minute huge overcrowded grab wait area screen show incoming car plate clearly demand way beyond airport could handle tired frustrate give grab hop catch bus instead werent allow buy ticket exactly 12 pm also list departure time late buy ticket 15 minute ahead tell bus would leave even 12 whole thing felt disorganized unclear wait time seem grab destination station even close hotel end pay double grab fare take regular taxi get hell airport logistical mess terrible first impression malaysia,Negative

"Ive traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always stood out for its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, is a beautiful highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of foreign and unique local offerings. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its due- the new bathrooms are a massive improvement! Well-designed, clean, and dry. But I cant ignore the disappointing shift in retail and dining options. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. Also why is alcohol and tobacco taking up a large portion of the retail space every time? I was shocked to find only one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a foodie havenwhy isnt KLIA showcasing its rich culinary heritage and diversity? Gone are the great local options that once served authentic dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles and teh tarik. Instead, global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans dominate the F&B spaces. Surely, theres room for more homegrown eateries that represent Malaysias incredible food culture? To add to the frustration, the monorail is still not working, and travelers have to rely on shuttle buses- slow and less efficient.

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling. This looks fancy but very old school. Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating Very confusing direction or procedure given. I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products. Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate when leaving from KL to overseas. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority. Airline still tier off the ticket manually. As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go. Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there. I went other less modern airport like ho chi Ming city or in Istanbul.

Highly Unprofessional Staff ( at least the one i dealt with ) waited almost 1.5 hours in the line there was my friend ahead of me and i was next. The lady officer she didnt asked him anything just held his passport and asked him to go to the immigration office ( He is a frequent traveller and has active visas for NZ and Uk ). I was next she saw me and told me to go too and doesnt even let me to go closer to the counter. We went to the immigration office and waited 6 hour for our number and when we were called the officer just asked me 2 questions literally 2 questions: 1 - How long you gonna stay. 2- Do you have a hotel booking. I was so heartbroken to hear these questions which the first officer could have asked me at the first place. I told the officer at the immigration about this whole scenario and she was shocked by herself and told me that she should not have sent me here and ask these questions by herself. Literally ruined my whole day almost 11 hours at the airport. Really disappointed because i was not expecting this kind of behaviour by a country which i was very excited to visit. If my review finds any person in charge please look into this matter. I know there are people who enters the country for illegal purposes like slipping or so but what about the legit tourists?

"KLIA is so huge, the potential clinical coldness of the facility is cleverly softened with what appears to be an atrium of greenery. The once state of the art facilities of this Airport is marred by the breakdown of the Aerotrain system that used to provide a world class service between the terminals. The Aerotrain gates have been hidden behind dark but colourful hoarding. Opposite the hoarding are lines of waiting passengers queuing to enter the various B gates, together with their various hand carry items. With poor lighting due to the height of the dark colourd hoarding, this creates a somewhat long dark narrow somber passage that arriving visitors to Malaysia must navigate to reach the escalators to the ground level and transfer bus terminal. Any negative impressions arising from negotiating past the queuing passengers with unsettled infants and the ocassional unrestrained child darting into the crowd flow is further accentuated as one reaches the ground level and confronted by the multinational crowd chaos at the Satellite Terminal bus transfer gate. The airport employees manning the area do a great job in moving the crowd in arbitrary groups onto the waiting buses. Despite the apparent crowd chaos, these Malaysian employees at various informal ""gates"" manage to prevent a crowd surge and create controlled access on to the buses. These lowly front line employees are the true heroes in this situation and are living examples of the ""Malaysia Boleh"" can-do attitude. It's such a pity senior Airport management doesn't display a similar level of commitment in getting the Aerotrain system fixed and creating a positive first impression for international arrivals to Malaysia.",huge potential clinical coldness facility cleverly soften appear atrium greenery state art facility airport mar breakdown aerotrain system use provide world class service terminal aerotrain gate hide behind dark colourful hoarding opposite hoarding line wait passenger queue enter various b gate together various hand carry item poor light due height dark colourd hoard create somewhat long dark narrow somber passage arrive visitor malaysia must navigate reach escalator ground level transfer bus terminal negative impression arise negotiate past queue passenger unsettled infant ocassional unrestrained child dart crowd flow accentuate one reach ground level confront multinational crowd chaos satellite terminal bus transfer gate airport employee man area great job move crowd arbitrary group onto wait bus despite apparent crowd chaos malaysian employee various informal gate manage prevent crowd surge create control access bus lowly front line employee true hero situation live example malaysia boleh cando attitude pity senior airport management doesnt display similar level commitment get aerotrain system fix create positive first impression international arrival malaysia,Negative

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member, who was shouting, to proceed to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall by bus. Was thinking that perhaps our flight was scheduled to park in a further lot due to multiple flights arriving around the same time,which requires us to do a short transit. Personally, I wasnt expecting to go through the hassle of having to transit from the plane to the arrival hall, taking into consideration that this was a direct flight. Anyway, still went with the flow and follow those in front since we are told to.... This information could easily be missed if people are talking or focused on finding the nearest toilet. Although the airport was large and packed with lots of shops and eateries, there are areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving/departure passengers. Would suggest the following improvements: * Rather than having a staff member shouting/giving instructions, can consider placing clear, large signage on both sides of the walkway as passengers disembark. * Provide more readily available information upon flight arrival / departure. * Consider adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Clear directional signs and information would make a big difference for first-time visitors like myself and would save a lot of time especially when there are so many incoming/outgoing flights day to day..... The signage for the bus transfer was unclear, and it took approximately 4-5 minutes to find the waiting point to queue for the feeder bus to the arrival hall. Upon arriving at the arrival hall, it was another 2-minute walk to reach immigration. The area was extremely crowded, with queues of 2-3 lines in a row, resulting in an hour-long wait to clear immigration. The process was very disorganized and messy, with no one managing the human traffic, possibly due to a shortage of manpower. Although the officers were friendly and efficient in clearing the queue, it would be beneficial to have crowd control/security to guide and manage the flow of passengers. Locating the correct baggage belt after clearing immigration was another challenge. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts, requiring passengers to walk near the belt to check the monitor screen. This was frustrating, especially with different groups of people surrounding the area, some looking for directions, some waiting for friends, and others searching for the right belt. We eventually found our luggage placed not far away from the luggage belt area near the exit, with a sign displaying the SQ Airlines logo on the floor. Many unclaimed bags from our flight were present, as most passengers were still stuck in immigration. The entire process, from disembarking the plane to retrieving our luggage outside the baggage claim area, was challenging. I thought we were only required to transit to the arrival hall as a one-time occurrence. However, on our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient. As a tourist, the airport gives the first impression for passengers, and its organization is crucial. I hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements",write provide feedback recent experience fly via singapore airline generally appreciate quality service singapore airline flight disappoint airport experience especially consider budget flight upon arrival disembark plane direct staff member shout proceed cxx transfer arrival hall bus think perhaps flight schedule park lot due multiple flight arrive around timewhich require u short transit personally wasnt expect go hassle transit plane arrival hall take consideration direct flight anyway still go flow follow front since tell information could easily miss people talk focus find near toilet although airport large pack lot shop eatery area could improve facilitate smooth transit arrivingdeparture passenger would suggest following improvement rather staff member shoutinggiving instruction consider place clear large signage side walkway passenger disembark provide readily available information upon flight arrival departure consider adjust volume announcement speaker loud clear information english chinese malay clear directional sign information would make big difference firsttime visitor like would save lot time especially many incomingoutgoing flight day day signage bus transfer unclear take approximately 45 minute find wait point queue feeder bus arrival hall upon arrive arrival hall another 2minute walk reach immigration area extremely crowd queue 23 line row result hourlong wait clear immigration process disorganized messy one manage human traffic possibly due shortage manpower although officer friendly efficient clear queue would beneficial crowd controlsecurity guide manage flow passenger locate correct baggage belt clear immigration another challenge area crowd three four luggage belt require passenger walk near belt check monitor screen frustrate especially different group people surround area look direction wait friend others search right belt eventually find luggage place far away luggage belt area near exit sign display sq airline logo floor many unclaimed bag flight present passenger still stick immigration entire process disembark plane retrieve luggage outside baggage claim area challenge think require transit arrival hall onetime occurrence however return flight require take short bus departure hall furthermore water dispenser available pass inspection gate inconvenient tourist airport give first impression passenger organization crucial hope feedback take consideration future improvement,Negative

"I had a deeply frustrating and disappointing experience at Kuala Lumpur Airport due to the unprofessionalism and rudeness of the staff. Upon arrival, I realized I had accidentally left my luggage in the restroom near the baggage claim. When I approached the information desk to ask for help, I received conflicting and unhelpful instructions. Some staff told me to go to the second floor, while others asked me to use an invalid boarding pass to re-enter security (which was impossible since my ticket was for a domestic flight from Kota Kinabalu). I ended up running back and forth between the second and third floors more than ten times, but no one took responsibility or provided any real assistance. Desperate, I approached a female staff member at the exit to request her help in checking the restroom for my luggage. Not only was she extremely reluctant, but she also glared at me in a hostile manner. After being persuaded by her colleague, she finally went to check the restroom. Within less than a minute, she came back and coldly told me my luggage wasnt there, claiming to have confirmed with the cleaning staff. However, this was simply not possible. Two hours later, left with no other options, I asked a passenger who hadnt exited yet to help me check the restroom. In just three minutes, they returned with my luggage. This experience was utterly unacceptable. The staffs lack of professionalism, unwillingness to help, and outright rudeness made an already stressful situation even worse. An airport should prioritize assisting passengers, not adding to their frustration. I hope the management will take serious steps to train their staff to ensure such incidents dont happen again.",deeply frustrating disappointing experience kuala lumpur airport due unprofessionalism rudeness staff upon arrival realize accidentally leave luggage restroom near baggage claim approach information desk ask help receive conflicting unhelpful instruction staff tell go second floor others ask use invalid boarding pas reenter security impossible since ticket domestic flight kota kinabalu end run back forth second third floor ten time one take responsibility provide real assistance desperate approach female staff member exit request help check restroom luggage extremely reluctant also glare hostile manner persuade colleague finally go check restroom within less minute come back coldly tell luggage wasnt claim confirm cleaning staff however simply possible two hour later leave option ask passenger hadnt exit yet help check restroom three minute return luggage experience utterly unacceptable staff lack professionalism unwillingness help outright rudeness make already stressful situation even bad airport prioritize assist passenger add frustration hope management take serious step train staff ensure incident dont happen,Negative

Inadequate Toilets: The women's restrooms were a mess - I waited in line for over 30 minutes and when it was finally my turn, they were dirty.

"This was by far the worst and most unacceptable experience Ive ever had with any airline. At the Batik Air baggage counter in Kuala Lumpur before flight OD171 to Denpasar, I was shouted at, threatened, and pressured into paying a baggage fee of 650 MYR, with the amount changing several times without explanation. First it was more, then less, then suddenly 650 it was chaotic and clearly unprofessional. The staff member at the baggage scale used aggressive language, raised their voice, and intimidated me in front of other passengers. I felt unsafe and coerced. This was not a normal excess baggage fee it felt like extortion. I complied because I felt I had no choice. This is absolutely not the standard I expect from any airline, especially not from Batik Air, which previously had my trust.

I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products. Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate when leaving from KL to overseas. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority. As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go.

"KLIA1 has undergone a number of upgrades in the past couple of years, particularly in terms of dining options on Level 5's Departure Hall (before security/immigration control) and duty-free shopping (after security/immigration control) in the main terminal. Work is still ongoing and hopefully we'll continue to see improvements in the months to come. My main problem with KLIA1 is the absence of any water refill stations at the passenger waiting area (boarding gates) after security clearance. Being a frequent flyer who's flown in and out of so many airports around the world, KLIA1 remains the only big airport that doesn't have this facility made available to passengers. I don't understand why the airport just doesn't address this issue as it's causing passengers (e.g., parents, senior travellers, etc.) so much inconvenience. Once passengers clears security, they won't access to any drinking water until they board their flight.

"I had two layovers at KLIA. The first time, everything went well: the airport was clean, well-organized, and especially a well-appointed prayer room, which is really appreciated by Muslim travelers. However, the second time was a completely different story, as if it weren't even the same place. As soon as you get off the plane, nothing is clear: there's almost no signage for baggage claim. It's easy to get lost, you don't know where to go. And then, surprise: you have to go through security and immigration before claiming your baggage. Completely illogical. At least let me collect my bag peacefully first! Once you're through immigration, you arrive in a huge crowd, with no smooth flow of traffic. Then you have to go through security again to get out. You board, you get off, you take a bus, you change buildings... frankly, a real hassle. Another point: the baggage counter agents are extremely strict, sometimes even abusive. If you weigh 5 kg more than you need, you pay, period, no flexibility. The prayer rooms? They used to be clean, now they're dilapidated, not maintained. Really a shame. Finally, I had a three-hour layover, I barely had time to navigate the obstacle course to get to my gate. And guess what? 40 minutes into the flight, our gate was changed from 35 to 4. Great. And then, as a Muslim, I felt uneasy. For a country I considered a brother, I had never felt so foreign. Clearly, Asian passengers are given priority. Sad to say, but I felt a real form of nationalism. In short, very disappointed. I didn't find the welcome I was hoping for in a country like Malaysia.",two layover first time everything go well airport clean wellorganized especially wellappointed prayer room really appreciate muslim traveler however second time completely different story werent even place soon get plane nothing clear there almost signage baggage claim easy get lose dont know go surprise go security immigration claim baggage completely illogical least let collect bag peacefully first youre immigration arrive huge crowd smooth flow traffic go security get board get take bus change building frankly real hassle another point baggage counter agent extremely strict sometimes even abusive weigh 5 kg need pay period flexibility prayer room use clean theyre dilapidate maintain really shame finally threehour layover barely time navigate obstacle course get gate guess 40 minute flight gate change 35 4 great muslim felt uneasy country consider brother never felt foreign clearly asian passenger give priority sad say felt real form nationalism short disappointed didnt find welcome hop country like malaysia,Negative

"Travel Tips for Kuala Lumpur: Save Money on Airport Transfers Avoid Grab e-Hailing, Especially Advance Bookings Grab drivers, particularly for advance bookings, may overcharge or provide subpar service. Instead, use Bolt for a more affordable and reliable ride. Bypass Airport Surcharges with Trains To avoid high airport ride-hailing fees, take the Express Rail Link (ERL) to Salak Tinggi station. From there, book a ride via Bolt for a significantly cheaper fare. Steer Clear of Airport Taxis Avoid taxis waiting at the airport, as they often charge exorbitant rates (RM300400). Opt for e-hailing services like Bolt, where fares to Kuala Lumpur should not exceed RM80 for a standard car or RM50 for a 4-seater. Know Your Rights with E-Hailing With e-hailing apps, pay only the fare shown in the app. If a driver demands extra payment, record their details (name, car plate number, and interaction) and report it to the nearest police station. Such behavior violates fair practices and harms Malaysias reputation. Pro Tip: Always book rides through trusted apps like Bolt for transparency and savings.

It just doesnt make sense. Its far too big to be an airport. The fact its also a shopping centre confuses things. You have a very long walk once you get off the flight and then have to also navigate out of the shopping centre which is confusing in itself. The way in (departing) there are queues and it is slow. Went through security once and then got water and food to then be told at the gate I cant take it through as there was another bag check. Once waiting at the gate there was no toilets. Youd think an airport of this size would then put toilets at the gate ? You can see the problem in this when you have to drink your water for the flight before you go through second round of security.

"KLIA is so huge, the potential clinical coldness of the facility is cleverly softened with what appears to be an atrium of greenery. The once state of the art facilities of this Airport is marred by the breakdown of the Aerotrain system that used to provide a world class service between the terminals. The Aerotrain gates have been hidden behind dark but colourful hoarding. Opposite the hoarding are lines of waiting passengers queuing to enter the various B gates, together with their various hand carry items. With poor lighting due to the height of the dark colourd hoarding, this creates a somewhat long dark narrow somber passage that arriving visitors to Malaysia must navigate to reach the escalators to the ground level and transfer bus terminal. Any negative impressions arising from negotiating past the queuing passengers with unsettled infants and the ocassional unrestrained child darting into the crowd flow is further accentuated as one reaches the ground level and confronted by the multinational crowd chaos at the Satellite Terminal bus transfer gate. The airport employees manning the area do a great job in moving the crowd in arbitrary groups onto the waiting buses. Despite the apparent crowd chaos, these Malaysian employees at various informal ""gates"" manage to prevent a crowd surge and create controlled access on to the buses. These lowly front line employees are the true heroes in this situation and are living examples of the ""Malaysia Boleh"" can-do attitude. It's such a pity senior Airport management doesn't display a similar level of commitment in getting the Aerotrain system fixed and creating a positive first impression for international arrivals to Malaysia.",huge potential clinical coldness facility cleverly soften appear atrium greenery state art facility airport mar breakdown aerotrain system use provide world class service terminal aerotrain gate hide behind dark colourful hoarding opposite hoarding line wait passenger queue enter various b gate together various hand carry item poor light due height dark colourd hoard create somewhat long dark narrow somber passage arrive visitor malaysia must navigate reach escalator ground level transfer bus terminal negative impression arise negotiate past queue passenger unsettled infant ocassional unrestrained child dart crowd flow accentuate one reach ground level confront multinational crowd chaos satellite terminal bus transfer gate airport employee man area great job move crowd arbitrary group onto wait bus despite apparent crowd chaos malaysian employee various informal gate manage prevent crowd surge create control access bus lowly front line employee true hero situation live example malaysia boleh cando attitude pity senior airport management doesnt display similar level commitment get aerotrain system fix create positive first impression international arrival malaysia,Negative

Only 2 (max 3) of the booths are open and staff are slow, disinterested and have no desire to speed up the process, as though they revel in seeing their visitors suffer.

Mohd Anuar bin Abdullah [1994] 2 MLJ 261) confirms that any intentional use of force without lawful justification meets this threshold. 2. **Wrongful Confinement (Penal Code Section 340)** The unlawful restriction of my movement within the clinic treatment room amounts to wrongful confinement. Malaysian jurisprudence establishes that detention without legal authority is punishable, particularly where no legitimate lien exists over the person. 3. **Official Misconduct** The behavior of Immigration Officer Kamarudin in: - Failing to properly address a criminal complaint - Intimidating a complainant - Improper use of personal devices to photograph sensitive documents May constitute offenses under Malaysia's official misconduct provisions.

"First and Last Time! It's my first time in Malaysia, traveling from Abu Dhabi. As a UAE resident, I take pride in the excellent regulations we have. However, I had a very disappointing experience at Kuala Lumpur Airport with a police officer named Azhar, who was checking baggage. He removed several of our items, including our shower gel, face wash, moisturizer, perfume, mouthwasher (almost finished the bottle)and even drinking water as well. My wife and I have never encountered such treatment at any airport before, and we were shocked to learn that these items are considered ""non-carryable"" on flights, the things cost more than 700 AED, very disappointed, and will never come again worst experience ever.

"I lined up to check in for my flight back to Japan more than three hours before, but I was hardly moving forward. I looked at the counter and saw that there were several windows open, but it seemed like it took a long time for each group, and it also took a long time to check the weight of my luggage. In the end, even though I arrived at the airport early, I waited in line for more than two hours before finally completing the boarding process. It took too long. I'm sure it's the airline that's taking so long, but I think they should give it a bit more thought and improve it. From there I headed to check my baggage, but normally it's done in one go, so I wonder what's going on as they check it three times here.

"Worst airport I've ever been to!!! Check-in/baggage drop took forever (despite online check-in) and there were also very long queues at the passport controls. So definitely plan plenty of time. We were there over 3 hours earlier, but in the end it was very close. There are few signs and information boards in the airport. DANGER!!! The absolute shame is the controls in front of the individual gates (no information about them beforehand). AFTER going through the duty free shop area, you will have to go through security checkpoints again and drink/throw away all of the liquids you purchased there. You even have to destroy the water you bought for the flight. In the area between security check and the plane there is no longer any possibility to buy drinks/food (nor any possibility to refill your empty bottle with water) or to go to the toilet. When I asked where I could get something to drink, all I got was an annoyed Buy in Plane.

"The airport looks very fancy and all - at least Terminal 1. It is very unorganized though. We arrived extremely late from our first flight (thank you batik air) and only had 15-20min to get our connecting flight. Normally airports would provide a shuttle services, picking you from a gate to bring you to your connecting flight in time. This was not the case here, we were only told the gate number of our connecting flight, which after running to for 10min, turned out to be the wrong gate. So instead we had to take the bus to another terminal, which obviously did not give us enough time to catch our flight, so we were stuck in KL for 1 night. Additionally it is ridiculous, that there is no smoking area in the entirety of terminal 1. So if you are stuck here for a while you have to go all the way to terminal 2, into one of the most disgusting smoking rooms Ive witnessed in my life (no ventilation at all, might as well just walk in and breath twice and youve already passively smoked a carton of cigarettes). Really disappointing for such a modern (only t1) and large airport.",airport look fancy least terminal 1 unorganized though arrive extremely late first flight thank batik air 1520min get connect flight normally airport would provide shuttle service pick gate bring connect flight time case tell gate number connect flight run 10min turn wrong gate instead take bus another terminal obviously give u enough time catch flight stick kl 1 night additionally ridiculous smoke area entirety terminal 1 stick go way terminal 2 one disgusting smoking room ive witness life ventilation might well walk breath twice youve already passively smoke carton cigarette really disappoint modern t1 large airport,Negative

"The customer service are horrible here. I know you guys dont speak English because thats not your first English but its so rude the way you guys talked to me. I have got a bad experience with this airport and Malaysia airline. Hi, Id like to complain about the experience today with Malaysia Airlines. I was so angry at the flight attendant so here is the complaint I sent to the Malaysia Airlines. I took the airplane from Malaysia to Auckland on July 8th. I have been getting bad service even I was at the airport in Malaysia. People who work here are so rude and they dont know how they talk with customers. I was on the airplane, there was no toilet paper in two bathrooms so I went to the back to use another bathroom. I didnt know where it was so I was looking for it and a flight attendant who named Rasher or something was being rude to me. I asked a man flight attendant what her name is. He was nine at least. So what happened is that when I was looking for the bathroom, she goes the bathroom is here with a disgusted look while she was on the phone even I didnt ask her anything. I was just looking. So I let her know there is no toilet paper in two bathrooms that I went to because she started talking to me even she was on the phone so I said to her nicely. And She said its in the middle. I was like what the hell is she talking about and thats your job to fill it up. Or she doesnt know thats her job lol The manager who said is in charge came to me and asked me what happened and she apologised me but the manager was asking me the flight attendant who was rude to me was on the phone right? Im like okay if she was on the phone, is she allowed to be rude to customers? Does that what she meant? And the rude one started talking to me in the first place not me. She could also say I would not mind to answer it after on the phone or not. Maybe she doesnt have a brain to make a grammar in English so she just said in the middle which I dont know what she meant. And then the rude one came to me to say sorry and she was trying to use she was on the phone as a excuse and she said oh she thought I started talking to her first bra bra bra which is not true. I felt she was trying to find some excuse to make her self look better in the situation. I could see that she doesnt feel sorry she was doing that because there was a manager next to her so I said I dont need apology from you because you already made me comfortable and its too late to apologise. When I said to her you were just doing this because your manager was next to you and she said okay. This kind of person would keep doing the same mistake because her apology doesnt mean anything to her. Ive never had a bad experience like this anywhere on airplanes. Malaysia Airline is horrible.

"Flight at 705am, we were ask to cross the checkpoint into immigration by 605am. We were 5 mins late, denied enterence, got ping pong around different department for 30mins.

Airline ground crew are locals, seemed oblivious and gave us the not my problem attitude.

"Compared to this airport, Incheon Airport is heaven. Kuala Lumpur Airport is a real pain in the ass for both departure and arrival. They dont even properly announce the arrival and departure of flights, immigration is slow, and not only is there queueing, but there are also long lines and no one knows which line is right. If you dare ask the staff a question, they just glare at you and ignore you. I feel like a prisoner, not a traveler. Immigration took 2 hours and 30 minutes. When departing, some boarding gates dont have restrooms. If you are assigned to such a gate, you have to go through a security check every time you go to the restroom. Delays of one hour are common, and I guess thats because the flight control treats us passengers like that.",compare airport incheon airport heaven kuala lumpur airport real pain as departure arrival dont even properly announce arrival departure flight immigration slow queue also long line one know line right dare ask staff question glare ignore feel like prisoner traveler immigration take 2 hour 30 minute depart boarding gate dont restroom assign gate go security check every time go restroom delay one hour common guess thats flight control treat u passenger like,Negative

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. Oh and did I mention that the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration? I had such a hard time to book the Grab and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, because there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!! This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia. I've never thought an airport would affect my will to visit a country but here we are.",airport make never want come back malaysia design place first walk plane immigration baggage claim unbelievably long ive travel many large airport ive never walk much reach luggage could overlook come next even bad collect bag pass immigration force walk get mall get exit yes literal mall every airport world youd check transportation finally leave long flight last thing anyone want drag maze store leave airport felt like cash grab travel hub finally make relieve see grab available use thailand book ride wait time 35 minute huge overcrowded grab wait area screen show incoming car plate clearly demand way beyond airport could handle tired frustrate give grab hop catch bus instead werent allow buy ticket exactly 12 also list departure time bus late buy ticket 15 minute ahead tell bus would leave even 12 whole thing felt disorganized unclear wait time seem grab destination station even close hotel end pay double grab fare take regular taxi get hell oh mention airport wifi available finish immigration hard time book grab check information chat airbnb host wifi immigration theres freakin mall airport exit airport logistical mess terrible first impression malaysia ive never think airport would affect visit country,Negative

"Arriving: Immigration for arrivals took too long! The officers works so slowly and the poor internet connection in this area is not helping either. It took us long enough to complete immigration to the point that our bags were no longer in the conveyor belt/shown on screen. Pick up location of ride hailing (Grab) was easy at Level 1. Departure: Check in counters are spread out making it not too crowded/congested. Immigration for departure is quicker and easier. However, there's a security screening for customs departure that was separated with at-gate security check. I would say this is very inefficient as you need to check your bags twice and once you have cleared security you practically cannot go out to the retail area. This also lead to congestion during Gate Open as people would avoid coming to it and come as late as possible. Security at the gate is so slow. In addition, the post-security gate is a nightmare with neither water stations nor proper toilet! There seems to be no signs of priority boarding based on group but rather by seats (not sure if this is an MH or KLIA problem). Retail space is decent with great tax-free goods options and decent restaurant selections.

"I had an extremely frustrating experience with the immigration process at this airport. The service was painfully slow, with long queues that seemed to move at a snails pace despite there being multiple counters. It felt disorganized and inefficient from the moment I arrived. What made it worse was the attitude of some of the immigration officers. Several of them appeared moody and unapproachable, offering no guidance or courtesy. Instead of helping travelersmany of whom were confused or exhaustedthey seemed irritated and dismissive. I understand their job isnt easy, but a basic level of respect and professionalism should still be expected. This kind of experience leaves a very poor impression, especially for international visitors. I hope the airport authorities seriously look into improving the staffing, training, and overall management of the immigration area.

When I approached the front desk to request a wheelchair, I was told to go all the way to the check-in area at the end of the terminal first. How is someone supposed to leave a person with dementia alone while they go fetch a wheelchair? We had no choice but to walk the entire distance, which completely defeats the purpose of offering assistance in the first place. To make matters worse, the check-in counter we needed was right at the end of the row. If my grandmother had truly been immobile, she wouldve had no way to reach that point on her own. Imagine if she were a solo disabled travellerwhat would have happened then? Even more disappointing was the staff attitude. There were six front counter staff chatting among themselves, not a single smile, not a trace of compassion or initiative. It felt like basic empathy and responsibility were missing entirely.

I have been to many major airports before, never faced something like this. What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: We hope youve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality. Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered.

"For such a major international hub, the airport felt a little confusing and chaotic. We ran into the same issue two times - once on arrival (for transit) and once for departure. During arrival we wanted to switch from C Gates to A/B gates for domestic departure but it was confusing to find the directions. Exactly at the same location, during departure, we had to switch to C gates but got confused. We later realised that one of the sign boards is actually wrong. It points to an escalator upwards that goes into the shopping area. Whereas the C gates entry is exactly in the opposite direction of the sign. For an international airport this is not acceptable at all. I dont have photos, but getting confused at the same place two times is not right. We saw a few others get confused too. Apart from that there is no major security check and body scan before immigration. However this is done prior to boarding. This is not as per standard processes elsewhere wherein the detailed security check and body scan is done immediately at entry. Somehow disappointed with the airport.",major international hub airport felt little confusing chaotic run issue two time arrival transit departure arrival want switch c gate ab gate domestic departure confuse find direction exactly location departure switch c gate get confuse later realise one sign board actually wrong point escalator upwards go shopping area whereas c gate entry exactly opposite direction sign international airport acceptable dont photo get confuse place two time right saw others get confuse apart major security check body scan immigration however do prior board per standard process elsewhere wherein detailed security check body scan do immediately entry somehow disappointed airport,Negative

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling. This looks fancy but very old school. Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating Very confusing direction or procedure. I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products. Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority. As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go. Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there.

"Ive traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always stood out for its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, is a beautiful highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of foreign and unique local offerings. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its due- the new bathrooms are a massive improvement! Well-designed, clean, and dry. But I cant ignore the disappointing shift in retail and dining options. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. Also why is alcohol and tobacco taking up a large portion of the retail space every time? I was shocked to find only one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a foodie havenwhy isnt KLIA showcasing its rich culinary heritage and diversity? This seem to now be engulfed by the blandness of foreign cafe franchises, croissants and cakes. Would be delightful to have more local options! Gone are the great local options that once served authentic dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles and teh tarik. Instead, global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans dominate the F&B spaces. Surely, theres room for more homegrown eateries that represent Malaysias incredible food culture? To add to the frustration, the monorail is still not working, and travelers have to rely on shuttle buses- slow and less efficient. And when I asked an Ask Me For Help staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phonecustomer service should be better than this. KLIA, we can do better!

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport was large and packed with lots of shops and eateries, there are areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving/departure passengers. Personally, I wasnt expecting to go through the hassle of having to transit from the plane to the arrival hall, taking into consideration that this was a direct flight. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member, who was shouting, to proceed to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall. This information could easily be missed if people are talking or focused on finding the nearest toilet. I tried to console myself, thinking that perhaps our flight was scheduled to park in a further lot due to multiple flights arriving around the same time. Anyway, just go with the flow and follow those in front since we are told to .... Would suggest the following improvements: * Rather than having a staff member shout instructions, you can consider placing clear, large signage on both sides of the walkway as passengers disembark. * Provide more readily available information upon flight arrival / departure. * Consider adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Clear directional signs and information would make a big difference for first-time visitors like myself and would save a lot of time especially when you have so many incoming/outgoing flights day to day..... The signage for the bus transfer was unclear, and it took approximately 4-5 minutes to find the waiting point to queue for the feeder bus to the arrival hall. Upon arriving at the arrival hall, it was another 2-minute walk to reach immigration. The area was extremely crowded, with queues of 2-3 lines in a row, resulting in an hour-long wait to clear immigration. The process was very disorganized and messy, with no one managing the human traffic, possibly due to a shortage of manpower. Although the officers were friendly and efficient in clearing the queue, it would be beneficial to have crowd control/security to guide and manage the flow of passengers. Locating the correct baggage belt after clearing immigration was another challenge. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts, requiring passengers to walk near the belt to check the monitor screen. This was frustrating, especially with different groups of people surrounding the area, some looking for directions, some waiting for friends, and others searching for the right belt. We eventually found our luggage placed not far away from the luggage belt area near the exit, with a sign displaying the SQ Airlines logo on the floor. Many unclaimed bags from our flight were present, as most passengers were still stuck in immigration. The entire process, from disembarking the plane to retrieving our luggage outside the baggage claim area, was challenging. I thought we were only required to transit to the arrival hall as a one-time occurrence. However, on our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient. As a tourist, the airport gives the first impression for passengers, and its organization is crucial. I hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements",write provide feedback recent experience fly via singapore airline generally appreciate quality service singapore airline flight disappoint airport experience especially consider budget flight although airport large pack lot shop eatery area could improve facilitate smooth transit arrivingdeparture passenger personally wasnt expect go hassle transit plane arrival hall take consideration direct flight upon arrival disembark plane direct staff member shout proceed cxx transfer arrival hall information could easily miss people talk focus find near toilet try console think perhaps flight schedule park lot due multiple flight arrive around time anyway go flow follow front since tell would suggest following improvement rather staff member shout instruction consider place clear large signage side walkway passenger disembark provide readily available information upon flight arrival departure consider adjust volume announcement speaker loud clear information english chinese malay clear directional sign information would make big difference firsttime visitor like would save lot time especially many incomingoutgoing flight day day signage bus transfer unclear take approximately 45 minute find wait point queue feeder bus arrival hall upon arrive arrival hall another 2minute walk reach immigration area extremely crowd queue 23 line row result hourlong wait clear immigration process disorganized messy one manage human traffic possibly due shortage manpower although officer friendly efficient clear queue would beneficial crowd controlsecurity guide manage flow passenger locate correct baggage belt clear immigration another challenge area crowd three four luggage belt require passenger walk near belt check monitor screen frustrate especially different group people surround area look direction wait friend others search right belt eventually find luggage place far away luggage belt area near exit sign display sq airline logo floor many unclaimed bag flight present passenger still stick immigration entire process disembark plane retrieve luggage outside baggage claim area challenge think require transit arrival hall onetime occurrence however return flight require take short bus departure hall furthermore water dispenser available pass inspection gate inconvenient tourist airport give first impression passenger organization crucial hope feedback take consideration future improvement,Negative

"Ive traveled through KLIA countless times, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight.

It was also very crowded when we went inside to eat. I thought fast food would be faster, but the line at Burger King, ordering and picking up, can take an hour. It's not even fast food!? In the end, we didn't have time to eat and had to take it to go. There wasn't a single store in the airport that we could explore. The inspection process here is also very unique. You can bring water through the first checkpoint, but you have to go through the X-ray machine again before boarding the plane. You can't bring water this time. You're directly on the plane. There's no place to fill up your water or use the vending machines. My throat was really sore before the in-flight meal arrived.

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, ""because it's too late now to buy tickets"" (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid almost triple the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. Oh and did I mention that the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration? I had such a hard time to book the Grab and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, because there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!!

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, ""because it's too late now to buy tickets"" (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid almost triple the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. And also, the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration! I had such a hard time to book the Grab taxi and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, in any airport that's when wifi is needed!! But here there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!! I've never had this much hastle and wasted time to manage to exit an airport. This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia. I've never thought an airport would affect my will to visit a country but here we are.",airport make never want come back malaysia design place first walk plane immigration baggage claim unbelievably long ive travel many large airport ive never walk much reach luggage could overlook come next even bad collect bag pass immigration force walk get mall get exit yes literal mall every airport world youd check transportation finally leave long flight last thing anyone want drag maze store leave airport felt like cash grab travel hub finally make relieve see grab available use thailand book ride wait time 35 minute huge overcrowded grab wait area screen show incoming car plate clearly demand way beyond airport could handle tired frustrate give grab hop catch bus instead werent allow buy ticket exactly 12 also list departure time bus late buy ticket 15 minute ahead tell bus would leave even 12 whole thing felt disorganized unclear wait time seem grab destination station even close hotel end pay almost triple grab fare take regular taxi get hell also airport wifi available finish immigration hard time book grab taxi check information chat airbnb host wifi immigration airport thats wifi need theres freakin mall airport exit ive never much hastle waste time manage exit airport airport logistical mess terrible first impression malaysia ive never think airport would affect visit country,Negative

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Malaysia is a major aviation hub known for its modern infrastructure and significant passenger capacity. It features two main terminals: KLIA1 (Main Terminal) for full-service airlines and KLIA2, which is the worlds largest terminal dedicated to low-cost carriers. Both terminals provide extensive amenities such as check-in counters, retail outlets, duty-free shops, lounges, and a range of dining options. Despite its impressive size and facilities, passenger experiences at KLIA show a mixed picture. Some travelers appreciate the airports efficiency, particularly with business class services that offer quick access to lounges and smooth security checks. The connectivity is good, with efficient transportation options like the KLIA Ekspres train linking the airport to Kuala Lumpur city center in under 30 minutes, plus taxis and buses are readily available. However, there are notable complaints that affect the overall impression. Passengers frequently cite poor staff behavior, long queues, and confusion during boarding and baggage checks, often describing staff as unfriendly or inattentive. Some criticize the immigration process, mentioning inconvenient requirements and poor assistance, especially for transit passengers. Food and beverage options, particularly in KLIA2, have received negative reviews for being limited, expensive, or insufficient for the passenger volume. Seating areas can be inadequate during peak times, and the indoor climate control sometimes falls short, making waiting uncomfortable. In terms of infrastructure, KLIA offers modern and clean facilities, with well-organized terminals and a spacious layout. The addition of automated train systems within KLIA1 and a skybridge in KLIA2 has improved passenger movement. The airport continues to be recognized for service quality by industry bodies, but in practice, staff performance and customer service remain areas needing improvement. Overall, KLIA is a modern and strategically important airport that provides extensive amenities and connectivity but is let down by inconsistent service quality and operational challenges that impact traveler satisfaction.Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Malaysia is a major and modern airport serving millions yearly, with two main terminals: KLIA1 for full-service airlines and KLIA2 dedicated to budget carriers. Both terminals feature extensive amenities including retail outlets, duty-free shops, lounges, and various dining options, supported by advanced infrastructure like automated trains and skybridges for smooth passenger transfers. While the airport excels in its size, facilities, and connectivityoffering quick transportation options like the KLIA Ekspres train to Kuala Lumpurit has garnered mixed overall reviews from travelers. Many praise KLIA1 for efficient and smooth security and boarding processes, especially for business class passengers. However, there are widespread complaints about staff attitude, with reports of unfriendly and inattentive personnel, chaotic queues, and confusing procedures that dampen the experience. Other common issues include limited food and beverage options, especially in KLIA2, overcrowded seating areas, and inconsistent indoor climate control, making waiting uncomfortable during peak times. Some travelers also find the immigration and transfer processes cumbersome, with poor assistance and odd paperwork requirements for transit passengers. Despite these challenges, KLIA maintains a clean and modern terminal environment with generally well-maintained facilities. It has received industry awards for its infrastructure and immigration service, but passenger experiences suggest that improving customer service and operational management is needed to match the airports world-class status.

The supermarket called JayaGROCER is also cheap. When you arrive, you can get to the city center by taking the KLIA Express, a limited express train, which is cheap and fast. However, there are restrictions on departure times, so if you want to get around easily, you should use the car dispatch service ""Grab"" or a taxi. The cheapest option is by far the bus.

"Very nice airport with a great viewing area. Plenty of food places and the souvenir shops sold items at good prices. They were of course higher than at shops, but for an airport, they were good. The baggage drop for British airways took a very long time. If flying with Malaysian airways and some other Asian airlines, there was practically no queue as it was self service. Then there was immigration, which opened up to more shops. After immigration, the bags were kind of scanned, but this wasn't security. This then opens up to more shops and restaurants.

"I used Terminal 2 (KLIA2), which is mainly used by low-cost carriers. There are many restaurants just outside the arrival gate, and many of them are open 24 hours a day, which is very convenient. There are many seats where you can charge your phones, and some stores have Wi-Fi. The food court a little further back to the left of the arrival gate has very cheap prices. The supermarket called JayaGROCER is also cheap. When you arrive, you can get to the city center by taking the KLIA Express, a limited express train, which is cheap and fast. However, there are restrictions on departure times, so if you want to get around easily, you should use the car dispatch service ""Grab"" or a taxi. The cheapest option is by far the bus. There is a luxurious lounge that accepts Priority Pass (3-hour system) at the back of LEVEL3, where the boarding gate is located, to the left.

"The airport is very large. Arrivals on a Tuesday evening were relatively smooth. Famous restaurants like Hua Yang and Hai Jiao Ren are located at the airport. I highly recommend checking them out first, as the lines at restaurants downtown are incredibly long. Departures on Saturday morning were a bit more chaotic, with incredibly crowded people and numerous check-in counters. They weren't divided by flight. From previous travel experience, children can't check in at the check-in counter. So, initially, we kept looking for a human check-in counter. We asked three staff members, each with a different explanation. This wasted a lot of time. It just so happened that our flight was delayed by an hour, otherwise we might have missed it. The restaurant in the airport lobby was incredibly crowded. After finally getting a table, it took another 30 minutes. We later discovered there were still many shops and restaurants after customs. Furthermore, baggage screening at customs required two checks, and the distance from customs to the boarding gate was quite long. On the way back, I recommend exploring and eating at the gate. You don't have to crowd the outermost area; the restaurants inside are just like the airport lobby. Best of all, they were less crowded, allowing you to leisurely wait for your flight. We had some fast food recommended by a local. The cola looked like root beer, served from a machine that looked like draft beer. It was quite interesting.

"Edit: upon arrival as of June 2025, they removed auto entry now for foreign passports and only locals can go through them- what a waste of automated gates! KLIA is a massive airport, but as of December 2024, its still undergoing some upgrading works, so not everything is fully operational (has been going on for the past year). Shops and dining options are still quite limited despite the airport's large size, which is a bit disappointing for travelers looking to explore or relax before their flights. On the positive side, for certain passport holders, the biometric scanning at immigration makes the process quick and efficient, which is a welcome convenience. However, the baggage scanning process remains tediousyoure required to scan your bags multiple times, such as when entering immigration and again when heading to your gate. Personally, this feels unnecessarily repetitive, but theres little travelers can do about it. Overall, KLIA has potential, and hopefully, the ongoing upgrades will bring noticeable improvements to both the facilities and passenger experience in the near future.",edit upon arrival june 2025 remove auto entry foreign passport local go waste automated gate massive airport december 2024 still undergo upgrading work everything fully operational go past year shop dining option still quite limited despite airport large size bit disappointing traveler look explore relax flight positive side certain passport holder biometric scanning immigration make process quick efficient welcome convenience however baggage scan process remain tediousyoure require scan bag multiple time enter immigration head gate personally feel unnecessarily repetitive theres little traveler overall potential hopefully ongoing upgrade bring noticeable improvement facility passenger experience near future,Neutral

"Very nice airport with a great viewing area. Plenty of food places and the souvenir shops sold items at good prices. They were of course higher than at shops, but for an airport, they were good. The baggage drop for British airways took a very long time. If flying with Malaysian airways and some other Asian airlines, there was practically no queue as it was self service. Then there was immigration, which opened up to more shops. After immigration, the bags were kind of scanned, but this wasn't security. This then opens up to more shops and restaurants. Only 1 out of the 4 water fountains worked at this point and the water was only for consumption in this area, because you then pass through security when the gate opens. After security, there are just seats. No water and no toilets. I found there to be a lot of walking around to the next point, but there many shops making it a good experience",nice airport great viewing area plenty food place souvenir shop sell item good price course high shop airport good baggage drop british airway take long time fly malaysian airway asian airline practically queue self service immigration open shop immigration bag kind scan wasnt security open shop restaurant 1 4 water fountain work point water consumption area pass security gate open security seat water toilet find lot walk around next point many shop make good experience,Neutral
"Wasn't really my cup of tea but more than adequate. Not sure why people are complaining though - not every airport is 5 stars. The terminals are split between buildings but at least the transfer buses are always available and the distance is short. There is ample lighting in the terminals and the areas that are dim are perfect for sleeping in. Gates are clearly signposted and the amount of walking is not too challenging. Not a lot to do here as shop selections are really minimal. Interestingly, KL was the place to shop back in the 1980s. Not sure what happened over the years but I'm suspecting the main flow of passengers transit through the Middle East (eg Dubai). The only irritating thing I found was unruly children banging on the piano in terminal C. 1 star for the parents!",wasnt really cup tea adequate sure people complain though every airport 5 star terminal split building least transfer bus always available distance short ample light terminal area dim perfect sleep gate clearly signpost amount walking challenge lot shop selection really minimal interestingly kl place shop back 1980s sure happen year im suspect main flow passenger transit middle east eg dubai irritating thing find unruly child bang piano terminal c 1 star parent,Neutral

"So first of all: the airport is big!!! The usual recommendation to be at the airport at least 3 hours before departure should be strictly adhered to. There are multiple floors and the terminal with Gates C is outside and requires an additional bus ride. Positive: There is a large selection of warm food and drinks in the Arrival Hall early in the morning. The Departure Hall is on the top floor and is very cluttered and full of people. It's important to stay calm and ask for the airline at the information counter. The signage at the counters is small and you would have to look through all of them until you find the right one. (If you fly with Etihad Airways... it's counter A.) It's best to check in online... it saves time. There were initially only a few counters open and some passengers had a lot of suitcases that were all weighed and labeled. The same thing happens with hand luggage. As soon as you have got rid of your checked baggage, it is best to go to immigration without hesitation and then you can stand in line again.

The KFC location is also not well-indicated, making it difficult for first-time visitors to find. On a positive note, the toilet cleanliness is commendable. The cleaning staff are diligent, ensuring the facilities are spotless after each use.

"Disappointed with KLIA1s Renovation Wheres the Local Flavor? Ive traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, easy check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, influenced by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, is a highlight. But what made KLIA truly special was the presence of local food, beverages, and products. With the recent renovation of KLIA1, I have to say I am very pleased with the new improved bathrooms- better designed, clean and dry :) But Ive noticed a disappointing shiftmany local offerings have been replaced by foreign goods, with alcohol and tobacco dominating the retail space. I was shocked to find only one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal! Malaysia is a foodie paradise with so much to offer- why isnt KLIA showcasing it? Previously, there were great local cafs serving authentic Malaysian dishes like prawn noodles and teh tarik. Now, all I see are global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans.

KLIA is a massive airport, but as of December 2024, its still undergoing some upgrading works, so not everything is fully operational (has been going on for the past year). Shops and dining options are still quite limited despite the airport's large size, which is a bit disappointing for travelers looking to explore or relax before their flights. On the positive side, for certain passport holders, the biometric scanning at immigration makes the process quick and efficient, which is a welcome convenience. However, the baggage scanning process remains tediousyoure required to scan your bags multiple times, such as when entering immigration and again when heading to your gate. Personally, this feels unnecessarily repetitive, but theres little travelers can do about it.

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is more than just a travel hub its a complete experience that blends efficiency, comfort, and a touch of Malaysian hospitality. From the moment you arrive, the design of the airport stands out. The main terminal building is bright, spacious, and airy, with a modern architectural style that still feels warm and welcoming. The satellite building, connected by the Aerotrain, adds to the sense of scale and convenience, making it easy for passengers to transfer between terminals. In terms of navigation, KLIA is well signposted, with clear directions in English and Malay. Even for first-time visitors, its relatively simple to find immigration, baggage claim, and onward connections. While the airport is large, the layout is intuitive, and staff members are friendly and ready to assist if you ever feel lost. Immigration and security checks are usually smooth and efficient, although during peak travel hours there can be queues nothing unusual for an airport of this size. The facilities here are excellent. There is a wide variety of food and drink options catering to every budget, from local Malaysian dishes (which I highly recommend if you have time) to international fast food, coffee shops, and sit-down restaurants. Shopping is also a highlight the duty-free selection is extensive, with everything from cosmetics and electronics to Malaysian souvenirs and delicacies. If youre in transit or have a long layover, KLIA makes the wait comfortable. There are plenty of lounges, seating areas, and even a capsule hotel where you can book a few hours of rest. The airport also has prayer rooms, child-friendly facilities, and smoking zones, which shows that it caters thoughtfully to different types of travelers. Free Wi-Fi is available, though it can sometimes be a little slow, so its good to have mobile data as backup. Getting to and from the airport is extremely convenient. The KLIA Ekspres train is one of the best features it takes just under 30 minutes to reach KL Sentral in the city center, and its fast, comfortable, and reliable. Taxis and ride-hailing services are also widely available, and buses provide budget-friendly options. One thing to keep in mind is that the airport is quite large, so be prepared to walk a fair bit between gates or from security to boarding. For some travelers, this can be tiring, but the clear signage and moving walkways help a lot. Overall, KLIA is a world-class airport that balances efficiency with comfort. Its clean, modern, and well-maintained, but it also has a distinct cultural touch that reminds you youre in Malaysia. Whether youre arriving, departing, or transiting, KLIA leaves a positive impression and sets the tone for a great journey.",kuala lumpur international airport travel hub complete experience blend efficiency comfort touch malaysian hospitality moment arrive design airport stand main terminal building bright spacious airy modern architectural style still feel warm welcome satellite building connect aerotrain add sense scale convenience make easy passenger transfer terminal term navigation well signpost clear direction english malay even firsttime visitor relatively simple find immigration baggage claim onward connection airport large layout intuitive staff member friendly ready assist ever feel lose immigration security check usually smooth efficient although peak travel hour queue nothing unusual airport size facility excellent wide variety food drink option cater every budget local malaysian dish highly recommend time international fast food coffee shop sitdown restaurant shopping also highlight dutyfree selection extensive everything cosmetic electronics malaysian souvenir delicacy youre transit long layover make wait comfortable plenty lounge seat area even capsule hotel book hour rest airport also prayer room childfriendly facility smoking zone show cater thoughtfully different type traveler free wifi available though sometimes little slow good mobile data backup get airport extremely convenient ekspres train one best feature take 30 minute reach kl sentral city center fast comfortable reliable taxi ridehailing service also widely available bus provide budgetfriendly option one thing keep mind airport quite large prepare walk fair bit gate security boarding traveler tire clear signage moving walkway help lot overall worldclass airport balance efficiency comfort clean modern wellmaintained also distinct cultural touch remind youre malaysia whether youre arrive depart transit leave positive impression set tone great journey,Positive

The best thing is when we checked in our luggage at Y12 we met counter girl so sweet looking very friendly very pleasant so helpful named Miss Raashini AP Shamugam had given us a deep sweet impression of the service provided by KLIA 2. Miss Raashini allowed me to take out some clothes when we have exceeded our limit of 20kg. We wish to apologise to Miss Raashini with our lack of knowledge we have unnoticely created a long queue behind us. We apologise for our action. We are truly Sorry. Other than the above Miss Raashini had advise us on the purchase of weight which is much cheaper when purchased on a different passenger. You can see that Miss Raashini is so honest when she can actually charge me extra few hundred for the additional weight on my luggage. We really appreciated the kindness Miss Raashini had provided us. We really appreciated KLIA 2 for providing us with a honest trusted service. We really appreciated you Miss Raashini.

"A seamless experience at KLIA, one of the best airports in Southeast Asia Traveling through Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is always comfortable and efficient. From the moment you arrive, you're greeted by a modern, clean, and well-organized facility, where it's clear that passenger comfort and overall smooth operation are a priority. Passport control is very streamlined, especially if you're eligible to use the automated e-gates (it's worth checking if your passport is listed). The entire process is quick and hassle-free, which is a great start to any international trip. Once you clear immigration, the airport is spacious and very well-maintained. The gates for Area C are easily reached via a regular shuttle train that departs after passport control. Everything is well signposted and easy to navigate. There are tons of options for both shopping and dining, so you'll never feel bored while you wait. From duty-free shops to local and international restaurants, there's plenty to discover before boarding. A helpful tip: KLIA is approximately 45 minutes from downtown Kuala Lumpur (KLCC) if you travel early in the morning when there's no traffic. During the day, it's a good idea to allow between one and one hour and ten minutes, depending on congestion. We traveled from Terminal 1, which serves many major international airlines such as Etihad (A), Emirates (B), Turkish Airlines (M), and several others. It's advisable to check your gate assignment in advance, as it can change shortly before departure! We had the opportunity to try Illy coffee near Gate C13. Although there was quite a line, service was quick once the order was placed. The staff was friendly and helpful. However, the coffee left something to be desired. The Americano and cappuccino had a strange taste, somewhat resembling burnt marshmallows. Still, the sourdough bakery selection was quite good, with fresh and satisfying options for pre-flight snacks. Overall, KLIA is an excellent international hub. Clean, efficient, and well-thought-out. If they improve the coffee quality a bit in some areas, it would be near perfect. Still, I would definitely transit or depart from KLIA again. Highly recommended for both frequent travelers and first-time flyers. Smooth Experience at KLIA - One of Southeast Asia's Best Airports! Traveling through Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is always a comfortable and efficient experience. From the moment you arrive, you're met with a clean, modern, and well-organized facility that clearly prioritizes both passenger comfort and operational efficiency. Passport control is a breeze, especially if you're eligible to use the automated e-gates (check if your passport is listed beforehand). The process is quick and fuss-free... a great start to any international journey Once you pass immigration, you'll find the airport impressively spacious and well-maintained. The departure gates at Concourse C are accessible by a smooth and regular train shuttle after passport control; very simple with clear signage throughout Retail and dining options are abundant, so you'll never feel bored during your wait. From duty-free shops to local and international eateries, there's plenty to explore while waiting for your flight. A small note on timing KLIA is located around 45 minutes from KLCC (city centre) early in the morning when traffic is light. However, during daytime hours, I recommend allowing at least 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes for the journey, depending on traffic conditions!!! We flew out of Terminal 1, which handles many major international carriers including Etihad (A), Emirates (B), Turkish Airlines (M) and several others.

Terminal 1 also has a satellite terminal, and there is an unmanned train between the main terminal and the satellite terminal. This takes just a moment. Terminal 1 also has a full range of duty-free shops and a wide selection of restaurants. At airport prices, though. I was happy to see an airport piano.

"This year, airport services have improved significantly compared to all previous years. For countries that do not require a visa, you can enter through the electronic gates, such as Malaysians. But when entering through these gates, your passport is not stamped, and you do not deal with any employee. You just put your passport on the gate, then look at the camera, and within seconds you enter Malaysia .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is undoubtedly one of the most modern and efficient hubs in Southeast Asia. The facilities are spacious, clean, and well-signposted, making travel easy, even for those unfamiliar with the area. Connections to the city center via the KLIA Express train are fast and convenient, allowing passengers to reach the capital in just 30 minutes. The dining scene is also varied, with local and international options available in both the arrivals and departures areas. The security and customer service staff are generally friendly and helpful, and immigration controls are usually relatively smooth if you don't arrive during rush hour. However, one of KLIA's major weaknesses is the limited number of rest areas for passengers in transit or with long layovers. Although there are some VIP lounges and capsule hotels with a fee, the airport doesn't offer enough comfortable public areas for reclining or sleeping, something that is sorely lacking when it comes to overnight waits or long connections. Improvements in this area would make the overall experience much more pleasant. In short, an efficient and modern airport, but one that needs to consider the comfort of travelers in transit more.",kuala lumpur international airport undoubtedly one modern efficient hub southeast asia facility spacious clean wellsignposted make travel easy even unfamiliar area connection city center via express train fast convenient allow passenger reach capital 30 minute din scene also vary local international option available arrival departure area security customer service staff generally friendly helpful immigration control usually relatively smooth dont arrive rush hour however one klias major weakness limited number rest area passenger transit long layover although vip lounge capsule hotel fee airport doesnt offer enough comfortable public area recline sleep something sorely lack come overnight wait long connection improvement area would make overall experience much pleasant short efficient modern airport one need consider comfort traveler transit,Positive

The transit area was relatively small compared to other airports so the staff only let you in when its like only minutes until the flight, which was understandable so I dont blame them - you can always settle for a drink or snack at a nearby stall.

"Modern, well-connected, and spacious international airport Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is one of Southeast Asias most impressive airports. Its clean, well-organized, and offers plenty of services for both international and domestic travelers. The airport is split into two terminals: KLIA (main terminal) for full-service airlines and KLIA2 for budget carriers like AirAsia. A free shuttle bus runs between them frequently, which is super convenient. The main terminal (KLIA) is spacious with high ceilings and even includes a small indoor rainforesta really unique touch! Immigration and customs can be slow during peak hours, but the staff are generally friendly and helpful. Signage throughout the airport is clear, and its easy to find your way around. KLIA2 is more modern in terms of retail options, offering a wide variety of shops, restaurants, and lounges. It has more of a shopping mall feel and is perfect if you have a long layover. However, walking distances can be long, so plan accordingly. The KLIA Ekspres train makes travel to and from downtown Kuala Lumpur quick and easy (about 30 minutes), which is a major plus. Some downsides include occasional delays at immigration and certain gates that require shuttle buses, which isnt ideal for tired travelers. Still, overall, KLIA is a great airportefficient, comfortable, and a solid first impression of Malaysia.",modern wellconnected spacious international airport kuala lumpur international airport one southeast asia impressive airport clean wellorganized offer plenty service international domestic traveler airport split two terminal main terminal fullservice airline klia2 budget carrier like airasia free shuttle bus run frequently super convenient main terminal spacious high ceiling even include small indoor rainforesta really unique touch immigration custom slow peak hour staff generally friendly helpful signage throughout airport clear easy find way around klia2 modern term retail option offer wide variety shops restaurant lounge shopping mall feel perfect long layover however walk distance long plan accordingly ekspres train make travel downtown kuala lumpur quick easy 30 minute major plus downside include occasional delay immigration certain gate require shuttle bus isnt ideal tired traveler still overall great airportefficient comfortable solid first impression malaysia,Positive

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) A Major Asian Hub with Smooth Connectivity | Travel Consultant Review As a travel consultant, I often recommend KLIA as a transit point or entry to Southeast Asia. Here's a breakdown of the experience: Highlights: Modern Infrastructure KLIA is clean, spacious, and well-designed. The terminalsKLIA (Main Terminal) and KLIA2 (Low-cost Terminal)are efficiently connected via train and shuttle. Connectivity Excellent connectivity via ERL (Express Rail Link) to central Kuala Lumpur in just ~30 minutes. Clear signage in English and Malay makes navigation easy for international travelers. Immigration & Security Immigration can be quick during non-peak hours, but delays are possible during busy times. Security is generally smooth and well-organized. Shopping & Amenities KLIA offers duty-free shops, premium brands, local crafts, and great food courts. Muslim prayer rooms, child play areas, lounges, and clean restrooms add to the comfort. Hospitality & Help Desks Friendly and professional staff. Help counters and digital info kiosks are helpful, especially for first-time visitors. Things to Keep in Mind: KLIA2 is separate and caters mostly to AirAsia and budget carriersplan accordingly if you have a connecting flight between KLIA and KLIA2. Transit times between gates can be long; allow extra time, especially for international connections. Consultants Tip: Use the Plaza Premium Lounge for long layoversits affordable and well-equipped.

It meant that there was plenty of space to sit and relax before the flight and quiet places could be found. On the minus side, it meant a lot of walking to get from place to place, and at times, I found it to be a bit chaotic and disorganised, finding our way around. It was a bit of a longer walk for us to get to the gate. Once there, we hopped on a bus that drove us across the terminal grounds. This took a while, too.

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) A Major Asian Hub with Smooth Connectivity | Travel Consultant Review As a travel consultant, I often recommend KLIA as a transit point or entry to Southeast Asia. Here's a breakdown of the experience: Highlights: Modern Infrastructure KLIA is clean, spacious, and well-designed. The terminalsKLIA (Main Terminal) and KLIA2 (Low-cost Terminal)are efficiently connected via train and shuttle. Connectivity Excellent connectivity via ERL (Express Rail Link) to central Kuala Lumpur in just ~30 minutes. Clear signage in English and Malay makes navigation easy for international travelers. Immigration & Security Immigration can be quick during non-peak hours, but delays are possible during busy times. Security is generally smooth and well-organized. Shopping & Amenities KLIA offers duty-free shops, premium brands, local crafts, and great food courts. Muslim prayer rooms, child play areas, lounges, and clean restrooms add to the comfort. Hospitality & Help Desks Friendly and professional staff. Help counters and digital info kiosks are helpful, especially for first-time visitors. Things to Keep in Mind: KLIA2 is separate and caters mostly to AirAsia and budget carriersplan accordingly if you have a connecting flight between KLIA and KLIA2.

"Kuala Lumpur international airport was one of the most magnificent airports I have been able to visit. This airport is the main hub to the huge city of Kuala Lumpur. Located almost 50km+ away from the actual city, this absolutely massive airport features numerous runways, and terminals. When we first arrived at the airport, we were relatively lost and confused! After more walking then my previous experiences in MLE, BLR, TRV, COK and CMB (all relatively smaller airports except BLR), we had to board a bus to another building in order to collect our baggage! The terminals itself are a bit well designed. The baggage collection carousels are absolutely humungous. The airport shuttle bus between terminals is a bit cramped though, when you are carrying the carry-on baggage. On the bright side, it does have seats which great. There is more greenery in the terminal than I'd have expected, it is spotless and extremely clean. There is large variety of resturants, other shops and sim/money exchange places (way more expensive than outside of airport). One thing I will highlight is the toilets are magnificent here. Whole other airports I've visited in India also have clean toilets, the hand drying systems aren't as advanced. I had a whale of a time inside the toilets in this airport, and I would rate them 5/5 star, no drama. When we went to the airport for our return flight back home, we saw more of the beautiful views and architecture of the airport. It is more easier to navigate the departures in my opinion. And, I'm sure for most people even arrivals won't be hard to navigate, it had been a while since we had flown anyways. I truly had a whale of a time in Kuala Lumpur international airport and was extremely impressed with the state of the art facilities. It also features KILA train service to the city center (KL Sentral) which is a cheaper alternative to redhing this airport (there quite far from the city). I'd love to visit Malaysia and this airport again in the future. Ps: the jetbridges are so much more convinent when boarding the airplanes! Really like those.",kuala lumpur international airport one magnificent airport able visit airport main hub huge city kuala lumpur locate almost 50km away actual city absolutely massive airport feature numerous runway terminal first arrive airport relatively lose confuse walking previous experience mle blr trv cok cmb relatively small airport except blr board bus another building order collect baggage terminal bit well design baggage collection carousel absolutely humungous airport shuttle bus terminal bit cramped though carry carryon baggage bright side seat great greenery terminal id expect spotless extremely clean large variety resturants shop simmoney exchange place way expensive outside airport one thing highlight toilet magnificent whole airport ive visit india also clean toilet hand dry system arent advanced whale time inside toilet airport would rate 55 star drama go airport return flight back home saw beautiful view architecture airport easy navigate departure opinion im sure people even arrival wont hard navigate since fly anyways truly whale time kuala lumpur international airport extremely impressed state art facility also feature kila train service city center kl sentral cheap alternative redhing airport quite far city id love visit malaysia airport future ps jetbridges much convinent board airplane really like,Positive

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA)! Get ready for a travel hub that's as bustling as a beehive and as modern as a sci-fi movie set! Imagine a place where you can embark on adventures, connect with people from all corners of the globe, and maybe even find a duty-free bargain or two! Picture yourself navigating the terminals, feeling like you're starring in your own international spy thriller (minus the actual danger, hopefully!), and wondering if you should grab one last cup of Malaysian teh tarik before boarding (spoiler alert: you definitely should!) . You can explore the shops, admire the architecture, and maybe even people-watch while waiting for your flight, feeling like you're witnessing a microcosm of the world! However, lets be honest, sometimes an ""international airport"" can feel a bit like a real-life game of ""dodge the rolling suitcases,"" where you're trying to navigate the crowds while also trying to avoid getting your toes run over . And while the excitement of travel is undeniable, you might also find yourself questioning your ability to resist the urge to buy all the travel-sized snacks, especially if you're a sucker for a pre-flight treat . Overall, Kuala Lumpur International Airport offers a dynamic and exciting experience, a place where you can start or end your journey, witness the magic of travel, and maybe even find a little bit of inspiration, even if you sometimes feel like youre participating in a synchronized airport-walking marathon with a hundred other jet-setting individuals.

Cleanliness, of washrooms, and immigration waiting times are as per international standard. The airport is recognized for its range of shops and dining options. The efficiency of the train connecting the terminals is also generally well-regarded. Overall, while KLIA has some impressive features and a wide array of services, consistent maintenance and customer service appear to be areas where improvements could enhance the passenger experience.

Check-in: Check-in was online. The baggage drop-off by car check-in was terrible. Security was very quick (around 7 a.m.). Immigration: Surprisingly quick. They only asked for my entry ticket, which was very strange and, of course, I didn't have it handy. If necessary, find a screenshot or email beforehand.

"Kuala Lumpur international airport was one of the most magnificent airports I have been able to visit. This airport is the main hub to the huge city of Kuala Lumpur. Located almost 50km+ away from the actual city, this absolutely massive airport features numerous runways, and terminals. When we first arrived at the airport, we were relatively lost and confused! After more walking then my previous experiences in MLE, BLR, TRV, COK and CMB (all relatively smaller airports except BLR), we had to board a bus to another building in order to collect our baggage! The terminals itself are a bit well designed. The baggage collection carousels are absolutely humungous. The airport shuttle bus between terminals is a bit cramped though, when you are carrying the carry-on baggage. On the bright side, it does have seats which great. There is more greenery in the terminal than I'd have expected, it is spotless and extremely clean. There is large variety of resturants, other shops and sim/money exchange places (way more expensive than outside of airport). One thing I will highlight is the toilets are magnificent here. Whole other airports I've visited in India also have clean toilets, the hand drying systems aren't as advanced. I had a whale of a time inside the toilets in this airport, and I would rate them 5/5 star, no drama. When we went to the airport for our return flight back home, we saw more of the beautiful views and architecture of the airport. It is more easier to navigate the departures in my opinion. And, I'm sure for most people even arrivals won't be hard to navigate, it had been a while since we had flown anyways. I truly had a whale of a time in Kuala Lumpur international airport and was extremely impressed with the state of the art facilities. It also features KILA train service to the city center (KL Sentral) which is a cheaper alternative to redhing this airport (there quite far from the city). I'd love to visit Malaysia and this airport again in the future. Ps: the jetbridges are so much more convinent when boarding the airplanes! Really like those.",kuala lumpur international airport one magnificent airport able visit airport main hub huge city kuala lumpur locate almost 50km away actual city absolutely massive airport feature numerous runway terminal first arrive airport relatively lose confuse walking previous experience mle blr trv cok cmb relatively small airport except blr board bus another building order collect baggage terminal bit well design baggage collection carousel absolutely humungous airport shuttle bus terminal bit cramped though carry carryon baggage bright side seat great greenery terminal id expect spotless extremely clean large variety resturants shop simmoney exchange place way expensive outside airport one thing highlight toilet magnificent whole airport ive visit india also clean toilet hand dry system arent advanced whale time inside toilet airport would rate 55 star drama go airport return flight back home saw beautiful view architecture airport easy navigate departure opinion im sure people even arrival wont hard navigate since fly anyways truly whale time kuala lumpur international airport extremely impressed state art facility also feature kila train service city center kl sentral cheap alternative redhing airport quite far city id love visit malaysia airport future ps jetbridges much convinent board airplane really like,Positive

"Modern, well-connected, and spacious international airport Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is one of Southeast Asias most impressive airports. Its clean, well-organized, and offers plenty of services for both international and domestic travelers. The airport is split into two terminals: KLIA (main terminal) for full-service airlines and KLIA2 for budget carriers like AirAsia. A free shuttle bus runs between them frequently, which is super convenient. The main terminal (KLIA) is spacious with high ceilings and even includes a small indoor rainforesta really unique touch! Immigration and customs can be slow during peak hours, but the staff are generally friendly and helpful. Signage throughout the airport is clear, and its easy to find your way around. KLIA2 is more modern in terms of retail options, offering a wide variety of shops, restaurants, and lounges. It has more of a shopping mall feel and is perfect if you have a long layover. However, walking distances can be long, so plan accordingly. The KLIA Ekspres train makes travel to and from downtown Kuala Lumpur quick and easy (about 30 minutes), which is a major plus. Some downsides include occasional delays at immigration and certain gates that require shuttle buses, which isnt ideal for tired travelers.

The entire incident happened at the last screening section before the boarding gate C26 while I was boarding my flight (PR 8526) back to Manila on 1st May 2025. I put my watch in an empty tray for sreening, however, I forgot to collect my watch after the screening. After about 15 minutes at the boarding area, that was when I noticed I had not collected my watch, I approached the screening staff. The staff didn't take my concern in a perfunctory manner but in fact patiently asked me about the physical design of my watch and what time I put my watch for screening. More than 4 staff really hunted high and low, left no stone unturned at the entire screening area to recover my lost watch.The staff also immediately coordinated with surveillance team, however, without any optimistic results of my lost watch, I had to board the aircraft without any further delay as the boarding gate was about to close. The staff then got my mobile number and email address. When I didn't hold out much hope on that, the airport staff handed my watch to me at my seat. Dear KLIA team, your swift action, professionalism, teamwork, and dedication to passengers care truly stood out and made a stressful experience to a posive one!

"Modern, well-connected, and spacious international airport Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is one of Southeast Asias most impressive airports. Its clean, well-organized, and offers plenty of services for both international and domestic travelers. The airport is split into two terminals: KLIA (main terminal) for full-service airlines and KLIA2 for budget carriers like AirAsia. A free shuttle bus runs between them frequently, which is super convenient. The main terminal (KLIA) is spacious with high ceilings and even includes a small indoor rainforesta really unique touch! Immigration and customs can be slow during peak hours, but the staff are generally friendly and helpful. Signage throughout the airport is clear, and its easy to find your way around. KLIA2 is more modern in terms of retail options, offering a wide variety of shops, restaurants, and lounges. It has more of a shopping mall feel and is perfect if you have a long layover. However, walking distances can be long, so plan accordingly. The KLIA Ekspres train makes travel to and from downtown Kuala Lumpur quick and easy (about 30 minutes), which is a major plus. Some downsides include occasional delays at immigration and certain gates that require shuttle buses, which isnt ideal for tired travelers. Still, overall, KLIA is a great airportefficient, comfortable, and a solid first impression of Malaysia.",modern wellconnected spacious international airport kuala lumpur international airport one southeast asia impressive airport clean wellorganized offer plenty service international domestic traveler airport split two terminal main terminal fullservice airline klia2 budget carrier like airasia free shuttle bus run frequently super convenient main terminal spacious high ceiling even include small indoor rainforesta really unique touch immigration custom slow peak hour staff generally friendly helpful signage throughout airport clear easy find way around klia2 modern term retail option offer wide variety shops restaurant lounge shopping mall feel perfect long layover however walk distance long plan accordingly ekspres train make travel downtown kuala lumpur quick easy 30 minute major plus downside include occasional delay immigration certain gate require shuttle bus isnt ideal tired traveler still overall great airportefficient comfortable solid first impression malaysia,Positive

"If you are looking for the capital airport of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur International Airport, this is definitely the one for you. It is big and spacious. It is a little far from the city, so please be careful when traveling. And don't make a mistake. It takes quite a while to get to the city. They use the windows well, and blend in well with nature. The facilities are also substantial, so you won't get bored even if you come a little early. If you don't arrive two hours before an international flight, you won't be able to deal with any sudden problems. I tend to be lazy and think, ""I can play a little more after that, right?!"", but if you consider the cost and time lost when you don't fly, it's better to go early. There are two airports in Kuala Lumpur, but the one in the city is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport. It does have international flights, but it only covers a very limited area. In terms of image, it's in a position similar to Osaka Itami Airport. It is unbeatable in terms of convenience, and if you live in the capital, this is definitely the best choice. It was a good idea to build a larger airport because it had become too small, but demolishing it would cause other problems, so they decided to leave it as it is.",look capital airport malaysia kuala lumpur international airport definitely one big spacious little far city please careful travel dont make mistake take quite get city use window well blend well nature facility also substantial wont get bore even come little early dont arrive two hour international flight wont able deal sudden problem tend lazy think play little right consider cost time lose dont fly good go early two airport kuala lumpur one city sultan abdul aziz shah airport international flight cover limited area term image position similar osaka itami airport unbeatable term convenience live capital definitely best choice good idea build large airport become small demolish would cause problem decide leave,Positive

"If you are looking for the capital airport of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur International Airport, this is definitely the one for you. It is big and spacious. It is a little far from the city, so please be careful when traveling. And don't make a mistake. It takes quite a while to get to the city. They use the windows well, and blend in well with nature. The facilities are also substantial, so you won't get bored even if you come a little early. If you don't arrive two hours before an international flight, you won't be able to deal with any sudden problems. I tend to be lazy and think, ""I can play a little more after that, right?!"", but if you consider the cost and time lost when you don't fly, it's better to go early. There are two airports in Kuala Lumpur, but the one in the city is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport. It does have international flights, but it only covers a very limited area. In terms of image, it's in a position similar to Osaka Itami Airport. It is unbeatable in terms of convenience, and if you live in the capital, this is definitely the best choice. It was a good idea to build a larger airport because it had become too small, but demolishing it would cause other problems, so they decided to leave it as it is.",look capital airport malaysia kuala lumpur international airport definitely one big spacious little far city please careful travel dont make mistake take quite get city use window well blend well nature facility also substantial wont get bore even come little early dont arrive two hour international flight wont able deal sudden problem tend lazy think play little right consider cost time lose dont fly good go early two airport kuala lumpur one city sultan abdul aziz shah airport international flight cover limited area term image position similar osaka itami airport unbeatable term convenience live capital definitely best choice good idea build large airport become small demolish would cause problem decide leave,Positive

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) A Major Asian Hub with Smooth Connectivity | Travel Consultant Review As a travel consultant, I often recommend KLIA as a transit point or entry to Southeast Asia. Here's a breakdown of the experience: Highlights: Modern Infrastructure KLIA is clean, spacious, and well-designed. The terminalsKLIA (Main Terminal) and KLIA2 (Low-cost Terminal)are efficiently connected via train and shuttle. Connectivity Excellent connectivity via ERL (Express Rail Link) to central Kuala Lumpur in just ~30 minutes. Clear signage in English and Malay makes navigation easy for international travelers. Immigration & Security Immigration can be quick during non-peak hours, but delays are possible during busy times. Security is generally smooth and well-organized. Shopping & Amenities KLIA offers duty-free shops, premium brands, local crafts, and great food courts. Muslim prayer rooms, child play areas, lounges, and clean restrooms add to the comfort. Hospitality & Help Desks Friendly and professional staff. Help counters and digital info kiosks are helpful, especially for first-time visitors. Things to Keep in Mind: KLIA2 is separate and caters mostly to AirAsia and budget carriersplan accordingly if you have a connecting flight between KLIA and KLIA2. Transit times between gates can be long; allow extra time, especially for international connections. Consultants Tip: Use the Plaza Premium Lounge for long layoversits affordable and well-equipped.

"My experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was generally very positive. The airport is modern, spacious, and well-organized. However, during arrival, there was a bit of confusion at the passport control stage. The signage wasnt very clear, especially when it came to directing passengers with foreign passports versus those with Malaysian ones they go through different gates. Additionally, all visitors are required to fill out a form regarding their stay in Malaysia. Thankfully, there are enough computers to do this at the airport ( you can do it on your device), but the process can take a little time. It requires having all your accommodation details ready, including the full address, which isnt always at your fingertips after a long flight. The form could definitely be a bit more user-friendly. On the other hand, the departure process was fantastic quick, smooth, and with no queues at all. It was honestly one of the most stress-free airport departures I've ever experienced. The airport wasnt overcrowded, which made everything feel relaxed and efficient. All in all, KLIA delivers a pleasant travel experience, especially if youre well-prepared on arrival. I'd definitely be happy to fly through here again!",experience kuala lumpur international airport generally positive airport modern spacious wellorganized however arrival bit confusion passport control stage signage wasnt clear especially come direct passenger foreign passport versus malaysian one go different gate additionally visitor require fill form regard stay malaysia thankfully enough computer airport device process take little time require accommodation detail ready include full address isnt always fingertip long flight form could definitely bit userfriendly hand departure process fantastic quick smooth queue honestly one stressfree airport departure ive ever experience airport wasnt overcrowd make everything feel relaxed efficient deliver pleasant travel experience especially youre wellprepared arrival id definitely happy fly,Positive

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is one of the most well-organized and clean airports Ive experienced in Southeast Asia. The moment you land, the airport greets you with a sense of calm, spacious design, and a touch of Malaysian hospitality. I arrived via an international flight at KLIA Terminal 1, and the immigration process was smooth and efficient, with polite officers and clear signage everywhere. The airport is modern and beautifully maintained, with plenty of seating areas, clean washrooms, and good connectivity to the city via the KLIA Ekspres train. It took me just under 30 minutes to reach KL Sentral, which was incredibly convenient. The shopping and dining options are diversefrom local Malaysian snacks to international chains and luxury brands. My only issue was the aerotrain between the main terminal and the satellite building being out of service, which meant taking shuttle buses instead. Also, baggage claim took a bit longer than expected. Despite that, the overall experience was pleasant. KLIA2, which I visited on a previous trip, was a bit more chaotic due to the budget airline crowd, but still fairly efficient. Overall, KLIA is a great international hub, well worth 4 stars, and Id happily fly through here again",kuala lumpur international airport one wellorganized clean airport ive experience southeast asia moment land airport greets sense calm spacious design touch malaysian hospitality arrive via international flight terminal 1 immigration process smooth efficient polite officer clear signage everywhere airport modern beautifully maintain plenty seat area clean washroom good connectivity city via ekspres train take 30 minute reach kl sentral incredibly convenient shopping dining option diversefrom local malaysian snack international chain luxury brand issue aerotrain main terminal satellite building service mean take shuttle bus instead also baggage claim take bit long expect despite overall experience pleasant klia2 visit previous trip bit chaotic due budget airline crowd still fairly efficient overall great international hub well worth 4 star id happily fly,Positive

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) Quick Review KLIA is one of Southeast Asias busiest and most modern airports, offering a smooth and efficient travel experience. Whats Great: Clean, spacious, and well-organized terminals (KLIA1 for full-service airlines, KLIA2 for budget carriers like AirAsia). Immigration and baggage handling are generally fast and well-managed. Excellent connectivity to the city via the KLIA Ekspres train (30 mins to KL Sentral). Plenty of dining options, duty-free shopping, and comfortable lounges. Free Wi-Fi that actually works well. What Could Be Better: KLIA2 can feel a bit chaotic and crowded during peak hours. Transit between KLIA1 and KLIA2 can take ~1015 minutes via shuttle/train.",kuala lumpur international airport quick review one southeast asias busiest modern airport offer smooth efficient travel experience whats great clean spacious wellorganized terminal klia1 fullservice airline klia2 budget carrier like airasia immigration baggage handling generally fast wellmanaged excellent connectivity city via ekspres train 30 min kl sentral plenty din option dutyfree shopping comfortable lounge free wifi actually work well could good klia2 feel bit chaotic crowd peak hour transit klia1 klia2 take 1015 minute via shuttletrain,Positive

"Arrived here around 3am and I was amazed because of the hassle-free queueing and not much documents needed but also very secured and organized, the airport seemed to be abandoned but in reality every transaction is really fast.

"KLIA (Kula Lumpur International AirPort) Terminal 1 is a well-designed, modern airport with spacious interiors, smooth immigration, and a good mix of dining and shopping options. The architecture is impressive, and premium lounges offer a relaxing experience for long layovers. However, the Aerotrain is currently down, so shuttle buses can cause delays during transfers. Also, limited water dispensers and gate specific security checks can be inconvenient for travelers. Overall, a clean, efficient, and traveler friendly airport just allow some extra time and keep a water bottle handy!",kula lumpur international airport terminal 1 welldesigned modern airport spacious interior smooth immigration good mix dining shopping option architecture impressive premium lounge offer relaxing experience long layover however aerotrain currently shuttle bus cause delay transfer also limit water dispenser gate specific security check inconvenient traveler overall clean efficient traveler friendly airport allow extra time keep water bottle handy,Positive

"Do plan ahead of time as there are 2 rounds of baggage screening. There are plenty of food options at the airport mall, near departure area and inside the transit area. You can refill water outside of the toilets after you pass the 2nd baggage screening. For arrival, I found myself walking a lot just to get to the baggage collection area. Easily a 10 mins walk.",plan ahead time 2 round baggage screening plenty food option airport mall near departure area inside transit area refill water outside toilet pass 2nd baggage screening arrival find walk lot get baggage collection area easily 10 min walk,Positive

"Flying out or landing in KLIA2? Heres a quick dose: KLIA2 opened in 2014 to replace the old LCCT (Low-Cost Carrier Terminal)and is now the home base for airlines like AirAsia and is one of the biggest purpose-built low-cost terminals in the world! Yes..so big you can literally walk 2km (I think its more..) inside to get to your boarding gate.so be sure to wear comfy shoes or your best cushioned disco sandals (or bring a scooter?) Gateway@KLIA2 is connected to the terminal, packed with food, stores & even a grocery! Its like a mini shopping mall with gates, to the extent you could arrive with just credit and dress up from top to bottom complete with rolling luggage to rock the day. Flying via KLIA2 makes you an early bird even if you are a marathon runner (kudos to you if you have pre-checked in and zero check in luggage). Get there at least 3 hours earlyimmigration lines can be sneaky long or check into the many aerohotels or capsule hotels (sama-sama) for a place to crash.

Currency exchanges are all around (RHBs rate is not bad) KLIA Ekspres from KL Sentral gets you there fast & comfy.

"The airport is modern, clean, and well-equipped with lots of shops and dining options. It looks great and feels spacious. However, the layout can be a little confusing at times especially when transferring between terminals or figuring out immigration and baggage. Still, staff are helpful and things generally run smoothly. Once you get the hang of it, its a pretty solid airport!",airport modern clean wellequipped lot shop din option look great feel spacious however layout little confusing time especially transfer terminal figure immigration baggage still staff helpful thing generally run smoothly get hang pretty solid airport,Positive
