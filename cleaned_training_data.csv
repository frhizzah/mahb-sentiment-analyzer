"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was nothing short of frustrating. From the airline to the moment I arrived, the service was abysmally slow, and the staff was unhelpful. Immigration staff, in particular, were rude and disrespectful, making an already stressful experience far worse. The flight was plagued with significant delays, and constant gate changes, making the entire experience chaotic. The in-flight safety video was unprofessional and disturbing, especially for young passengers. This attempt at engagement was tasteless and unnecessary. Additionally, the constant gate changes and flight delays created confusion and anxiety throughout my entire time at the airport. Having to take a bus between terminals was highly inconvenient and only added to the frustration. What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: We hope youve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality. Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered. Given this experience, I will never fly with Malaysian Airlines or visit Malaysia again and I certainly won't be encouraging my friends or family to visit.","My recent experience Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) nothing short frustrate .

"Ive traveled through KLIA countless times, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its due- the new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well designed, good ventilation, clean and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail spacewhy so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradisewhy isnt KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign coffe chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti? Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysias rich culinary diversity?- take a page out of Jakarta or Singapore airport. To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (Ive lost count how long Ive waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an Ask Me For Help staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone. Customer service should be better than this! KLIA, lets do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers. P.S. if youre ever at the Satellite building of KLIA terminal 1 (after the shuttle service), I highly recommend visiting the Jungle Boardwalk - a small beautiful green forest in the middle of the building I always look forward to visiting it if my Gate is located there.","Ive travel KLIA countless time , always impress cleanliness , smooth check-in process , efficient security check .

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling. This looks fancy but very old school. Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating Very confusing direction or procedure. I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products. Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority. As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go. Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there. I went other less modern airport like ho chi Ming city or in Istanbul. Where still have better experience than in Malaysia","I bad experience travel . This look fancy old school .

"We went to terminal 2 to get our flights, very disappointed with Air Asia, they werent helpful at all!

Also they charged so much if there is extra luggage! Very dissatisfied and Very poor Organization!

"It's a gigantic airport, but unlike other mega-airports, it's not easy to find your way around. Fortunately, the police and airport staff are very friendly and helpful. But you have to be prepared for time and take things slowly. To board a domestic flight from an international airport, it took us almost an hour, including the transfer (by bus), then the elevator, then reprinting the boarding pass (because the previous one no longer worked), then finding the domestic flight exit, then going through carry-on baggage control (you have to remove all electronic devices from your backpack, unlike at other airports where they are checked inside your luggage).

"Exhausting.. you need to have at least a year of airport work experience to just transit through this airport. It took nearly 2 hrs from landing to sitting down at our gate. So much is automated, and very few staff members to help, so when something goes wrong - like when the self bag-drop off machine stops working.. with one of our bags halfway through the conveyor, we were left for ages, not knowing what to do. So many more hurdles to jump such as filling in an MDAC, yes, we were asked to fill it in on-line at Siem Reap, but thought it couldn't possibly be for us as so many 'mandatory' boxes were irrelevant to us. However, at the airport, they insisted we filled it in with a bunch of false information, i.e. the address where we would be staying (had to put in an they address provided.. which was the airport's address) a waste of time, as we felt we could miss our connecting flight. We also had to create our own baggage tags, then TWO separate baggage screenings - so unnecessary. So many options of queues without clear instructions, so many people, so much walking - it just seemed chaotic. It's not my favourite airport. If we weren't so tired.. we had been travelling all day, I would have said a pretty average airport.","Exhausting .. need least year work experience transit . It take nearly 2 hr land sit gate .

"Average airport, but pricey. Coffee, sandwich, travel necessities - be prepared to pay more. 2 coffees plus 2 sandwiches equaled almost RM120. At least there are some dispensers for free water. Boarding is very slow due to extra security checks at the gates. Plan at least another 30-40 minutes (the difference between the boarding time on your ticket vs the actual boarding time) for this second and very slow check. Once youre through this gate security check, theres a waiting area with no toilets and no water. So please take care is your needs BEFORE queueing for the gate security check. Second, the gate security check is hyper sensitive. My wifes passport - which she held in her hand - triggered it. They make you take off shoes and belts if those contain small metal bits.

"Unfortunately, my experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was disappointing. Here are a few points that struck me negatively: 1. Strict baggage control, but not consistent: My hand luggage was accurately weighed, and even though it was only slightly over 7kg, I was told to pay extra. At the same time, the Malaysian woman in front of me, weighing almost 8 kg, was allowed to walk away - that felt unfair. 2. Poor Signage: Some gates had no numbers, which was extremely confusing. It was difficult to find the right path. 3. Lack of seating: There were no seats at the gate, which made the wait unnecessarily tiring. 4. Inadequate Toilets: The women's restrooms were a mess - I waited in line for over 30 minutes and when it was finally my turn, they were dirty.

"Since the sale of cigarettes and tobacco is legal in the country, there should be smoking areas at every Terminal. Smoking is Legal and it would be a good thing, in 2025, not to make smokers who travel feel ghettoized. You cannot make them spend hours in front of the gates without ensuring a smoking area. It is embarrassing for a world capital. Those who smoke in designated areas do not cause any harm to non-smokers: following and pursuing these embarrassing policies is only harmful.","Since sale cigarette tobacco legal country , smoke area every Terminal .

"Exactly about a week ago, when I was returning to my country from KLIA 1, I had an unpleasant experience with the X-ray staff at the gate, who had no manners! During immigration and security checks, I threw away my little brother's water bottle because I knew that international flights don't allow drinks exceeding 100ml. After that, I saw a water dispenser before entering the gate. I filled it up there... But as I was about to enter the gate, the unmannered officer yelled at me and told me to throw the water in the toilet, using a rude tone! And even worse, when I threw the water in the toilet, my mother was also scolded by the X-ray staff... Crazy, they really have no manners towards their elders! If drinks aren't allowed in the waiting room, please provide them in the waiting room... Are your airport staff going to take responsibility if we get thirsty? The airport has the worst and strangest regulations I've ever visited... So different from Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand!

"Unfortunately, there are still no 0 stars on Google! Most of the staff were very friendly, only the ladies at C15 for boarding today's TK0061 were the worst! Rude and mean. The fact that a proper security check only takes place immediately before entering the gate is completely pointless and simply stupid. There are no longer any opportunities to refill your water bottle or buy anything for a long flight at the gate itself. Whoever came up with this system will hopefully pay for it.

"KLIA2 is by far the most disappointing terminal, starting with the immigration service, which completely kills any desire to ever return here. Weve been to Malaysia many times, arriving through KLIA, but weve never seen such chaos. Over 300 people in line, and only 8 counters open - and working incredibly slowly! We waited in line for 1.5 (!) hours. Whats the point of filling out the online arrival form if immigration officers still spend 4-7 minutes on each tourist? After standing in line for over 1.5 hours and watching how the officers worked, we were left very disappointed. Even worse was how immigration officers treated Asian travelers with darker skin - their gestures were so disrespectful, it was truly unpleasant to witness. Ah, yes! And before departure immigration process took 30 minutes at 6:30am. A reasonable processing time at passenger-respecting airports around the world is 1520 minutes. But not at KLIA2 - here, the staff act like theyre doing you a favor by letting you enter or leave the country.

"Layout is confusing and staff are horrible, especially the immigration staff.

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was nothing short of frustrating. From the airline to the moment I arrived, the service was abysmally slow, and the staff was unhelpful. The immigration officers are rude and disrespectful, making an already stressful experience far worse. To be honest, it felt like the staff were completely uninterested in their job, and some even seemed to resent being there. When my family arrived at the immigration counter, the officer seemed confused when we asked whether he wanted to see our MDAC or passports first. He glanced at our passports and then repeatedly said, ""You dont look British."" When we asked why he was being rude, he flew into a rage and yelled, ""What do you mean I am being rude! Youre not welcome here. Go back to where you came from."" At first, I thought I could be overreacting, but as the situation unfolded, it made me wonder if this could be a case of racial bias, especially toward darker-skinned people. Its hard not to perceive this as racism when the treatment felt so harsh and unwarranted. But then, a white female tourist recounted her own experience, and she was visibly shaken, nearly on the verge of tears. She too had been yelled at and bullied by the Malaysian airport staff. To make matters worse, I also witnessed an Indian woman being denied entry to the bathroom just to retrieve her bag. After numerous attempts she managed to get them back. This made me realize that it wasnt just about skin colourthough it was hard not to make that connectionbut rather a broader issue with the staffs attitude toward tourist and travellers. The customer service here has drastically declined. This used to be a place where visitors were welcomed with warmth and respect, but unfortunately, thats no longer the case. Its a shame to see such a decline. In Malaysia, government jobs, including those at airports prioritize ethnic Malays over Indian and Chinese Malays. As a result, some government positions, such as immigration officers or airport staff, may be filled based on ethnicity rather than merit or qualifications. Due to this, individuals in these roles might lack the necessary qualifications or passion for the job, which can sometimes be reflected in their job performance and attitude. What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: We hope youve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality. Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered. Given this experience, I will never fly with Malaysian Airlines or visit Malaysia again and I certainly won't be encouraging my friends or family to visit. Avoid countries that do not respect and appreciate tourist coming to help their economy!","My recent experience Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) nothing short frustrate .

"After 2 weeks of trip in Malaysia, I headed to KLIA terminal 2 for my next destination. Due to the unexpected flight delay, I had to wait 7 hours, outside of security check points. I was quite surprised that this big international airport doesnt have a single seat for public who have to wait for flights. Only way to find seats were eating or drinking in the restaurant.

"Dear Airport Authority, I am writing to formally express my disappointment regarding my experience at KLIA 2 on 28 January 2025 at 3:38 AM while waiting for the departure hall to open. One of your customer service staff (a Chinese male) informed us that the hall would open at 3:00 AM. However, when the hall was still closed at 3:10 AM, we asked another staff member (a Malay female), who then told us it would open at 4:00 AM. When we mentioned that her colleague had stated an earlier opening time, her response was: ""Then you ikut apa yang dia cakap lah."" When we further inquired about the actual opening time, she dismissively said: ""Then you tunggu hall buka lah."" I find this attitude highly unprofessional and unacceptable, especially for airport staff who are expected to assist passengers courteously. Providing inconsistent information and responding rudely to simple inquiries only creates confusion and frustration. I urge you to look into this matter and ensure that staff are properly trained to handle customer queries in a respectful and professional manner. Additionally, clear and accurate information regarding the departure hall opening time should be provided to avoid unnecessary inconvenience for passengers. I appreciate your prompt attention to this issue and look forward to your response.","Dear Airport Authority , I write formally express disappointment regard experience KLIA 2 28 January 2025 3:38 AM wait departure hall open .

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. Oh and did I mention that the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration? I had such a hard time to book the Grab and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, because there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!!

"KLIA is an international airport that always feels like a poor budget airport that is falling apart. Ironically, it is overstaffed by an army of smiling greeters. On Sunday, 22 June 2025, we saw water dispenser stations broken and unrepaired. ""Free drinks"" stations abandoned, unmanned. The only smoking room in the airport is a filthy room covered in black soot: incredibly smelly, no ventilation systems, piles of ash, trash, and butts all over. Warning: Enter at your own risk. The aerotrain was being repaired, and although bus services were provided, no signs were available to passengers on where it is. Bus services from the sub terminal to the main terminal were not easy to find. Tragically, the contrast between KLIA and KLIA2 (the latter an actual budget terminal that's well designed, modern, clean, and efficient) has never been clearer.","KLIA international always feel like poor budget fall apart .

"Once touted as a modern design airport with state of the art facilities, this has fallen far where maintenance has taken a back seat. The train which services between the terminals has not run for 2 years at least, the air-conditioning is either turned to a low level or not functioning cos I was sweating profusely while waiting in line (check in). There's more to add to the list of woes, but anyway, it is a point of transit, and it works. Could really do with sprucing up. After all, it's the first impression of our country for millions of visitors.","Once tout modern design state art facility , fall far maintenance take back seat .

"This was by far the worst and most unacceptable experience Ive ever had with any airline. At the Batik Air baggage counter in Kuala Lumpur before flight OD171 to Denpasar, I was shouted at, threatened, and pressured into paying a baggage fee of 650 MYR, with the amount changing several times without explanation. First it was more, then less, then suddenly 650 it was chaotic and clearly unprofessional. The staff member at the baggage scale used aggressive language, raised their voice, and intimidated me in front of other passengers. I felt unsafe and coerced. This was not a normal excess baggage fee it felt like extortion. I complied because I felt I had no choice. This is absolutely not the standard I expect from any airline, especially not from Batik Air, which previously had my trust. I have filed a formal complaint with the airline and am awaiting a refund and investigation. I strongly warn other travelers: If youre flying from Kuala Lumpur with Batik Air, be cautious at the baggage counter. Keep records, film interactions, and dont let yourself be bullied.","This far bad unacceptable experience Ive ever airline .

"I had an extremely disappointing experience at Malaysias Airport Terminal 2. It was overcrowded with long lines, and the staff was not only unhelpful but also rude. One of the officers took my Dior and Chanel perfumes, which were under 100ml and purchased from duty-free, claiming they were not allowed. He kept them in his pocket without any proper explanation. In addition, he confiscated all of my expensive purchases and seemed greedy and unprofessional, as though he had never seen such items before. He even pressured me by asking, Do you want to catch your flight or not? This made me feel very intimidated, especially since I was traveling alone. Furthermore, although I was allowed 7kgs in check-in, the lady at the counter charged me approximately 130 RM for an extra weight charge, despite my prior allowance.

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers. These include clearer directional signs and more readily available information. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member to go to C15 for a transfer to the arrival hall. The signage for this transfer was unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus. Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldnt it be better to have basic international standard too? The situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall. The area was extremely crowded,people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration. Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic which leads to all these mess. After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for. The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when everyone was looking for the right belt for their luggage. Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right. We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the Singapore Airlines logo on the floor. Quite a handful of luggage was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight were still stuck in immigration. Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt. Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage much of which was in Malay. This can be rather challenging, especially after a series of such ""events"" we went through. We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter, who knows we must go through the same things going back. On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.We have to endure our thirst till our flight take off. As a tourist, I dont enjoy it if I have to go through so much hassle just to travel. Who doesnt want hassle-free travel? For the sake of everyone, I hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.","I write provide feedback recent experience fly KLIA via Singapore Airlines .

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling. This looks fancy but very old school. Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating Very confusing direction or procedure given. I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products. Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate when leaving from KL to overseas. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority. As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go. Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there. I went other less modern airport like ho chi Ming city or in Istanbul.

One of the worst airports in the world. The airlines and the airport will not inform if they change boarding gate. They tell you fight delayed and so you wait at the gate. The boarding gate is changed but you are still waiting at the original boarding gate and nobody bothers to inform you that the boarding gate is changed. You continue to wait at the original boarding gate until the flight leaves from the changed boarding gate. Leaving you stranded. Updated 28th Feb. Last night I asked a police constable if the carparks is free and she looked at me shocked. I said I just drove in at the auto gate. She said the system has taken a photo of you car number and will charge you accordingly. O said,One bad airport world . The airline inform change board gate . They tell fight delayed wait gate .

"Honestly, if you are of African, Chinese, Philippines, Indian, Bengali, Nepalese, any south or south east Asian country think twice before boarding a plane to tour Malaysia or to transiting at Kula Lumpur airport. If you had a good time at this airport, great. If you didn't, avoid it in the future. The officers that work here are nothing more than poor uneducated people given jobs because they are Muslim Malays. If you are travelling alone they will judge you based on your colour and ethnicity. I have learnt that a lot of bullying and physical assualt are subjected to people of Bengali, Burmese, Nepalese or sub continent backgrounds. This was specifically from a foreign worker and have verified a lot of similar cases from trip advisor. I had a friend who witnessed a group of 3-4 female Malaysian officers trying to steal the bag of an Indian girl of Aus/US/UK (can't tell the exact accent) nationality. I have also seen people get shouted and others being hit! Like what the hell! I have never seen such uncivilised behaviour at an international airport, and I have been to numerous airports across Asia and the middle east. A lot of Malaysian officers are also thieves. Be careful. I have heard of several incidents where they target individuals travelling alone, in pairs or in small groups getting pulled aside, physically hit and having money taken unlawfully from them. Though I'm not surprised. It's a Muslim majority country. Usually these people tout about honesty and peace but actually are the polar opposite rude, violent and openly steal. Like I said, if you are from an African, south or south east Asian background (note specifically not nationality but background) don't bother even going through the airport let alone holidaying here.

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, ""because it's too late now to buy tickets"" (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid almost triple the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. And also, the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration! I had such a hard time to book the Grab taxi and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, in any airport that's when wifi is needed!! But here there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!! I've never had this much hastle and wasted time to manage to exit an airport. This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia. I've never thought an airport would affect my will to visit a country but here we are.","This make never want come back Malaysia . Who design place ? !

"Ive traveled through KLIA countless times, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its due- the new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well designed, good ventilation, clean and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail spacewhy so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradisewhy isnt KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign caf chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti? Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysias rich culinary diversity?- take a page out of Jakarta or Singapore airport. To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (Ive lost count how long Ive waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an Ask Me For Help staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone. Customer service should be better than this! KLIA, lets do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers. P.S. if youre ever at the Satellite building of KLIA terminal 1, I highly recommend checking out the Jungle Boardwalk I always look forward to visiting it if my Gate is located there.","Ive travel KLIA countless time , always impress cleanliness , smooth check-in process , efficient security check .

"One of the worst airports I've ever been to. The staff is incredibly nonchalant, more busy checking their phones than helping passengers in difficulty. We arrived 30 minutes before boarding, but the agent at the counter categorically refused to let us through. He didn't even bother to call the gate to let us know we were there or try to find a solution. I know you have to arrive 1 hour before check-in and 30 minutes before boarding, but this was truly exceptional. Background: Our first flight (with Air Asia) was delayed by 1 hour, which left us only 45 minutes to check in for our second flight (with Malaysia Airlines). And in those 45 minutes, we had to: exit immigration, fill out immigration paperwork, take a taxi (because the train between the terminals was closed), go through customs again in the other terminal, and then take another bus to get to the plane, which is impossible to do in 45 minutes. Changing terminals was a real nightmare: the train connecting the terminals was out of service, so we had to retrace our steps to catch a taxi, which we had to pay for ourselves at a reception deskwhere, once again, the staff seemed more engrossed in their phones than in their work. After the first agent refused, we tried our luck at another check-in kiosk (using a machine); other people were there. We explained the situation, and to get through, we had to lie by saying that ""the man at the counter had given us the green light."" At that point, we were let through. Immigration and customs literally told us to run! But when we arrived at the boarding gate, just a minute before departure, they categorically refused to let us board. The staff were there, on their phones, with no desire to help. One woman even pretended to call someone to tell us that ""it's over, the doors are closed,"" before literally turning her back on us. All this because of a delay by one of their partner airlines, and there was no flexibility, no consideration. The result: we had to buy new tickets, this time with Emirates. And there, however, nothing to complain abouttop-notch welcome, professional service.","One bad airport I 've ever . The staff incredibly nonchalant , busy check phone help passenger difficulty .

"It might be more appropriate to call it Kuala Lumpur Airport rather than 'International.' While the airport is generally clean and well-lit, the transit area is underwhelming. Wi-Fi connectivity is slow, and there are limited food and retail options. A significant upgrade or expansion is needed if the airport aims to keep up with other regional hubs. Additionally, the transport pick-up experience at Terminal 2 was a nightmare. The poorly designed two-lane pick-up area created severe congestion, and we ended up waiting over an hour just to be picked up. It's unclear who was responsible for this layout, but it clearly needs a serious rethink","It might appropriate call Kuala Lumpur Airport rather 'International .

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers. - These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member..standing at the side, to go to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall. - Wouldn't it be better to put up clear large signage at both sides of the walkway while we disembarked? - Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. The signage for this bus transfer was also unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus. Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldnt it be better to have a basic international standard too? Not sure if the timing we arrived is a peak season but that day itself,the no.of passengers is not a joke. The situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall. The area was extremely crowded, and people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration. Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to manage the human traffic, which leads to all these mess. Good thing is the officer trying their level best to clear the queue. After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was another challenge. The area was so crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you are required to walk near the belt to check on the monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for. The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when there are different groups of people surrounding the area....some was like lost souls looking for directions, while some gather in between the way waiting for their friends, and you have those looking up and low for the right belt for their luggage. We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the SQ Airlines logo on the floor. There was quite a handful of luggage that was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight as us were still stuck in immigration. Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt.... This can be rather challenging, especially after coming a long ""way"" out from immigration Thought we are only required to transit to the arrival hall as a 1 time off thingy. Who knows, we must go through the same things even for departure. On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient. We have to endure our thirst till our flight takes off. As a tourist, the airport gives the 1st impression for passengers and how they are organized. Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.","I write provide feedback recent experience fly KLIA via Singapore Airlines .

It's a big airport with lots of amenities and shopping options. Food is limited to asian food. Very few veggie options. I did not find Indian cuisine anywhere. The security and check in were easy and the airline staff including the other airport staff were helpful. They could make it more intuitive right from the entry gate. The gates are not very well placed. Passengers will face discomfort as early arrivers won't be allowed to sit in the lobby,It 's big lot amenity shopping option . Food limit asian food .

For some ridiculous reason they only place security for international flights just before the gate (gates C at least). This means you can't bring any water bottles on the flight - not even any that you just bought in the airport! And no chance to refill them post security either. So you have to rely on the plastic mini bottles they provide you during your upcoming 7+ hour flight. Wholly inefficient and wasteful in this day and age. I expected better from a modern hub like KL. For the rest the main hall and transportation on site is fine.,For ridiculous reason place security international flight gate ( gate C least ) .

"Exhausting.. you need to have at least a year of airport work experience to just transit through this airport. It took nearly 2 hrs from landing to sitting down at our gate. So much is automated, and very few staff members to help, so when something goes wrong - like when the self bag-drop off machine stops working.. with one of our bags halfway through the conveyor, we were left for ages, not knowing what to do. So many more hurdles to jump such as filling in an MDAC, yes, we were asked to fill it in on-line at Siem Reap, but thought it couldn't possibly be for us as so many 'mandatory' boxes were irrelevant to us. However, at the airport, they insisted we filled it in with a bunch of false information, i.e. the address where we would be staying (had to put in an address that they provided.. which was the airport's address) a waste of time, as we felt we could miss our connecting flight. We also had to create our own baggage tags, then TWO separate baggage screenings - so unnecessary. There are so many options of queues without clear instructions, so many people, so much walking - it just seemed chaotic. It's not my favourite airport. If we weren't so tired.. we had been travelling all day, I would have said a pretty average airport.","Exhausting .. need least year work experience transit . It take nearly 2 hr land sit gate .

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was unfortunately extremely disappointing. Firstly, the staff were generally unfriendly and appeared to have minimal understanding of English, which made basic communication difficult to impossible. More critically, there was a noticeable general incompetence across various functions. Staff seemed unable or unwilling to perform their duties, such as overseeing passengers and maintaining order in the queues. An additional major point of inefficiency was the self-service process: I was directed to the scanner by immigration staff, only for the scanner to then instruct me to return to the immigration counter, causing further unnecessary delays and frustration. I repeatedly observed an absolute lack of professional supervision, where people were simply allowed to cut in line or where queues dissolved into chaos without any staff intervention. This combination of poor (and by times even disrespectful) customer service, language barriers, and failure to enforce basic operational procedures led to unnecessary stress and delays. It's clear that KLIA urgently needs to invest in significantly better training for its personnel, focusing on customer service, language proficiency, and core job efficiency.

"I recently traveled to Malaysia with my family, including young children, and was extremely disappointed by the poor management at the airport upon our arrival. After our plane landed, we had to wait for two full hours just to get through immigration. The lines were incredibly long, and there were no clear directions, very few staff members to assist, and an overall lack of organization in managing the arriving passengers. My children and elderly family members were forced to stand the entire time, which was both exhausting and unacceptable after a long flight. I expected better from a major international airport. There was no prioritization for families with children, no proper communication, and very little effort to speed up the process. It felt like the airport was completely unprepared to handle the volume of passengers arriving. My advice to the airport management: Please improve the arrival process by increasing staff at immigration counters, organizing separate queues for families, and providing clearer signage and communication. Travelers come to Malaysia expecting hospitality and efficiency unfortunately, this experience was neither welcoming nor efficient. I hope my feedback will be taken seriously to ensure a better experience for future visitors.","I recently travel Malaysia family , include young child , extremely disappointed poor management upon arrival .

"While leaving Kuala Lumpur Airport in Malaysia, the scary robber called the Malaysian police and checked my passport, searched me, took my $1200 and 5500 ringgit, said he would take me to the office, and took me to the stairs. When I asked for my ringgit back, he beat me, kept 900 ringgit and returned all the ringgit and dollars. I was in a panic and a terrible state. I have been to three or four countries before, this has not happened.

"The nation's pride and joy needs to be updated. It is looking really dated and tired compared to other international airports. There is very limited vibrance as compared to the rest. Aerotrain is still out of order. Taking busses to the satellite building is like aged old way of moving in the airport. First and business class passengers have a separate bus which has larger and lesser seats. However, the exhaust is still an issue. Only MAS passengers get the i5 via the same place. Service however is good. The bus is at the G gates and there is a personnel who chaperones passenger to the busses. There are also coffee machines and comfy sofas at the bus area. Don't quite understand rationale for this as who ever that is already there will very likely want to get to the satellite building lounges quickly. Hence, no one can be seen there save and except for staff.","The nation 's pride joy need update . It look really date tire compare international airport . There limited vibrance compare rest .

I want to give zero star to this airport. My brother and his friends wanted to visit Malaysia. He booked a trip for 4 days with his friends. They had confirmed ticket for a round trip.

The people working at the airport are fraud and demanding $100 from travelers. The police are holding on to every traveler passport.

There were Chinese tourists who were stuck, and they couldn't understand the error message that was in English. But there was not a single staff present? How can such gates be left unattended? All other tourists behind were left stranded. After the e-gates, our bags were scanned. So we emptied out all our water. In the departure hall we spotted water coolers so we refilled our bottles. As we were walking to the gate, there was suddenly another security screening?? And so we had to empty our bottles again?? Guess what, the water coolers at the boarding gate were not working. Passengers at T2 are on budget flights with no beverages. We needed the water. Also, the whole airport smelt of vomit and pee.

"It's still a great airport that meet the customers demand, but there are some run down facility and hardware, such as aged carpet with visible discoloration at the arrival hall, and some run down toilets with dim lamps. However the immigration section has been improved to cater the huge crowd of tourists. That's a good thing. Nevertheless, the custom checkpoint no longer provide the green zone for people with light luggages to walk thru. Everyone has to queue up to pass thru the custom checkpoint, where the officers will randomly pick any large luggage to scan for taxable items. So, be prepared for that. By the way, the departure hall do not have any water dispenser for you to refill your water bottle. You have to buy water with a sealed plastic bag (the bag is not free), in order to take it into the waiting hall. This is allowed by security check at the waiting hall. The new aerotrain ride between the satellite building and main building was good. Albeit it is a new train, there were a few events of disruption due to technical glitch (via news portals), so be prepared to take the buses again.","It 's still great meet customer demand , run facility hardware , age carpet visible discoloration arrival hall , run toilet dim lamp .

"Airport staff are really the worst here. All eligible countries that are allowed to use the e-gate were forced to use the immigration line, but there are very few staff at the immigration line to manage it. On top of that, when going to the nearest immigration counter the staff was rude and said ""this one is only for business class"" even though the line was empty. So you ultimately have counters that are over capacity cause they have implemented a e-gate system that doesn't work and a set of counters that have staff and no users cause they don't have the right ""boarding pass"". Airport itself is okay, but the operations are a disgrace to such a beautiful city. KLIA Do better.

Being a rapidly growing global destination Kuala Lumpur deserves a far better airport. kLIA T1 lacks the glitter and glamour flaunted by other major airports. The immigration and baggage claim areas lacked room and felt claustrophobic, especially considering the volume of passengers handled by the airport. Neither the airport has any attention grabbing design language to it Navigating within the airport was a bit tricky at the outset. Taxi pickup points are easy to identify and communicate Overall the experience was just average. Again, KL deserves a far better airport","Terminal 1 KLIA disappointing .

The worst airport ever. Got hours early for flight check-in with an insane long queue. Then the immigration queue which is so ridiculously long with only few counters available. Finally the customs check queue. Total of 3+hours of waiting in those long queues. Noticed some people missed their flights and staffs not helping to give an express queue for those near-miss flights. I have seen lots of queues in other airports but not as slow as this.,The bad ever . Got hour early flight check-in insane long queue . Then immigration queue ridiculously long counter available .

Worst airport in the whole world. Before boarding the flight you are forced to bin your water and there's no way to refill it. You'll have to rely on the airplane to provide you water throughout the flight. Why can't they hire smarter people to manage this place? The train has been out of order for years. Don't deserve any salary.,Worst whole world . Before board flight force bin water 's way refill . You 'll rely airplane provide water throughout flight . Why ca n't hire smarter people manage place ?

"Worst airport Ive ever been at. When I landed I stood in line for 1,5 hours at immigration!! Landed in terminal 2 and my next flight was from terminal 1, the shuttle bus took 20-30 minutes. After I checked in for my next line I had to stand another hour to get thru immigration??? I almost missed my flight, my layover was 3,5-4 hours and I still had to run to the plane when it was boarding!! People working at the airport are not helpful. Very ineffective airport!!

There is a second security at ALL the gates and so you can't take water on board. Batik airlines forces you to buy water on the plane. This is a violation of human rights. The airport is really loud in general and experienced sensory overload. There is a lack of toilets so the queues are extremely long. I will give an extra star because the shops and food choice are good.,There second security ALL gate ca n't take water board . Batik airline force buy water plane . This violation human right .

"We recently traveled from Malaysia to Cochin via KLIA with AirAsia, and unfortunately, the experience with the ground staff was very disappointing. We wanted to check in our baggage directly at the counter instead of using the kiosk, and when we asked the staff about it, their response was rude and unhelpful. They just told us to either use the kiosk or pay cash and try another counter, with no intention to assist further. At the V counter, a staff member initially told us to join the queue. But when we reached the front, the person issuing boarding passes and bag tags questioned how we got there and rudely told us to go back. Even when we explained that another AirAsia staff member had asked us to wait in line, she denied it outright, saying no one from their team would do that. There was a serious lack of coordination, professionalism, and courtesy from the ground staff. It left a very bad impression on us. AirAsia should really consider training their ground staff better, especially when handling international travelers who expect basic respect and guidance.","We recently travel Malaysia Cochin via KLIA AirAsia , unfortunately , experience ground staff disappointing .

"KLIA1 Renovation: A Step Forward, But Wheres the Local Charm? Ive traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its duethe new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well-designed, clean, and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail spacewhy so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradisewhy isnt KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign caf chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti? Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysias rich culinary diversity? To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (Ive lost count how long Ive waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an Ask Me For Help staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone. Customer service should be better than this! KLIA, lets do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers.","KLIA1 Renovation : A Step Forward , But Wheres Local Charm ?

"One of the worst airports I have ever been to. I had a flight on 24th August, 2025 from KUL to Chennai at 9.30PM. I went to the airport by 5PM and completed my check-in by 5.30PM. I then went to immigration and it took hours and hours to complete the immigration. There were 3 queues and only 2 officers per queue working at their own pace. The line kept on getting bigger and bigger as the time passed, but still the immigration officers didnt show any responsibility in helping us fast track the process. I was literally waiting for more than 4 hours in line and even after requesting them multiple times about my flight timings they simply told This is how it is and if you are late you will miss the flight. Its really a very poor management by Malaysian airport and I feel its something really serious which they need to address. If the queue is high, please manage it in such a way to add more officers in duty to avoid the commotion.","One bad airport I ever . I flight 24th August , 2025 KUL Chennai 9.30PM .

"The airport is modern, spacious, and generally well-run. However, there were a few moments of confusion worth mentioning. Upon arrival, the immigration process was not clearly marked. Passengers with Malaysian passports go through a different gate than those with foreign passports, but the signage didnt make that obvious. Additionally, all international visitors must fill out a digital arrival form about their stay. There were enough computers available to do this at the airport, but the form isnt very intuitive, and it requires knowing the exact address of your accommodation. It could definitely be made more user-friendly. The departure experience was quick, smooth, and without queues. However, just before boarding the plane, there was a second bag check, and surprisingly, you couldnt bring any drinks on board not even those in your own bottles or purchased in the terminal. Only drinks sealed in security bags by the shop were allowed, and not all stores offer this option. Unfortunately, no one informed us of this at the time of purchase, which was frustrating and once again showed a lack of clear communication.","The modern , spacious , generally well-run .

"This airport is quite impressive, but the distance to the next gate is really far, and I ended up pretty tired from walking. The international departure lounge is really small, disorganized, and lacks proper management. The toilet maintenance is poor, and the cleanliness is not well-kept. Also, there are very few seats in the corridor before entering the waiting area, so a lot of people have to sit on the floor, almost like a refugee camp. There are very few water dispensers and phone charging stations, and people have to wait in line just to charge their phones. The immigration staff is unfriendly and treats passengers rudely. Overall, it was a pretty disappointing experience at this airport.","This quite impressive , distance next gate really far , I end pretty tire walk .

And when I tried to suggest politely to the worker there to tell her manager to improve the system, so old people and pregnant women can get the seat in advance, the security guy came to ask what was my passport (as a sign of threat - yet smoothly) 2. The positions of the seat are ridiculous (check picture), with no space for the legs at all. 3.

"My second trip through Kuala Lumpur International Airport was unfortunately just as frustrating as the first. The customer service here is a huge problem. I asked multiple staff members for help with basic info, and every single one just shrugged, said ""I don't know"" and acted like it wasn't their job. There was zero effort to even try and find out. It's truly baffling. Then there's the internal airport bus with no proper monitoring. We had our 5-month-old with us and we literally had to stand for a 5-minute ride between gates. The bus wasn't even packed but everyone was too busy hogging their spot to offer one up to someone struggling with a baby. The fear of losing balance and dropping our infant was terrifying. People just sat there watching us, completely uncaring. To top it off, we saw a couple of electric buggies nearby, clearly for passenger assistance, but there was no one to drive them! We asked four different staff if they could help us get one, and each time, we got the same clueless ""I don't know"" response. For an international airport, the lack of basic help and common courtesy is really poor. Traveling with a baby is already tough enough, and KLIA just made it worse. I'll definitely be trying to avoid this airport next time.","My second trip Kuala Lumpur International Airport unfortunately frustrating first . The customer service huge problem .

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was nothing short of frustrating. The immigration officers are rude and disrespectful, making an already stressful experience far worse. To be honest, it felt like the staff were completely uninterested in their job, and some even seemed to resent being there. In Malaysia, government jobs, including those at airports prioritize ethnic Malays over Indian and Chinese Malays. As a result, some government positions, such as immigration officers or airport staff, may be filled based on ethnicity rather than merit or qualifications. Due to this, individuals in these roles might lack the necessary qualifications or passion for the job, which can sometimes be reflected in their job performance and attitude. What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: We hope youve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality. Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered. Given this experience, I will never fly with Malaysian Airlines or visit Malaysia again and I certainly won't be encouraging my friends or family to visit. Avoid countries that do not respect and appreciate tourist coming to help their economy!","My recent experience Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) nothing short frustrate .

"I love Malaysia and have visited many times, but KLIA is honestly one of the worst airport experiences Ive ever had. We arrived as a family with kids (8 months, 3, 7, and 9 years old). The family/elderly lane was a joke the officer let some families with older kids go through, but told us only our 1 years baby can enter with his mother and the rest should go another Lane. When I asked why, he completely ignored me. It felt discriminatory and unprofessional. Immigration was a nightmare: 75 minutes in line just for slow biometric checks, while our luggage was left unattended off the belt. On the return back home, an immigration officer told us our family was too big and refused to process all six passports, forcing us to split up. I have never seen such behavior in any international airport. Most Immigration officers were too rude. To make things worse: Batik Air check-in staff were rude and lied about baggage weight, and duty-free prices were ridiculously overpriced (almost 3x more than outside). All of this happened in one single trip. For a country that wants to be a top tourist destination, KLIA is a serious embarrassment.","I love Malaysia visit many time , KLIA honestly one bad experience Ive ever .

Having the water facilities when travelling is a real fundamental, to deny this basic is generally flawed! What an awful way to travel!

"Unfortunately, my experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was disappointing. Here are a few points that struck me negatively: 1. Strict baggage control, but not consistent: My hand luggage was accurately weighed, and even though it was only slightly over 6kg, I was told to pay extra. At the same time, the Malaysian woman in front of me, weighing almost 8 kg, was allowed to walk away - that felt unfair. 2. Poor Signage: Some gates had no numbers, which was extremely confusing. It was difficult to find the right path. 3. Lack of seating: There were no seats at the gate, which made the wait unnecessarily tiring. 4. Inadequate Toilets: The women's restrooms were a mess - I waited in line for over 30 minutes and when it was finally my turn, they were dirty. The men apparently had enough toilets as there were no queues. Unfortunately, the airport was the worst I've ever been to.","Unfortunately , experience Kuala Lumpur International Airport disappoint .

"Horrible, just horrible!! The worst experience in my life, and I've been to many airports. Automation of everything is disgusting! Figure out for yourself why you can't go through the passport to go out into the city. Figure out for yourself the form to fill out. (Like a visa on arrival) Do the check-in yourself. (What if the phone is dead?) Although in my case there were problems with access to the Internet, also take this into account! Check in your luggage yourself. And if there is a problem, then figure out for yourself which line to stand in this time, and all the employees don't give a damn, even if you are seeing such automation for the first time!! We wanted to stand in line to see a real person first, but the road was blocked by a tape and people were not allowed in, although the registration was still ongoing :/ Now I am sitting in this ""wonderful"" airport and I hope that I did everything right and my luggage will not fly off to where it should not And for some reason another check before the gate, strange. It was terminal 2, we will never get a visa run here again The only plus is the cleanliness of the airport and fast customs control My advice to everyone who has not seen such automation ""do it yourself"" is to come for at least 3 hours, it's brutal","Horrible , horrible ! !

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers. - These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member..standing at the side, to go to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall. Rather than having a staff member saying out to those passengers embarking, there might be a chance people will miss that important message. - Wouldn't it be better to put up clear large signage at both sides of the walkway while we disembarked? - Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. The signage for this bus transfer was also unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus. Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldnt it be better to have a basic international standard too? The situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall. The area was extremely crowded, and people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration. Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic, which leads to all these mess. After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for. The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when there are different groups of people surrounding the area....some was like lost souls looking for directions, while some gather in between the way waiting for their friends, and you have those looking up and low for the right belt for their luggage. Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right. We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the SQ Airlines logo on the floor. There was quite a handful of luggage that was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight as us were still stuck in immigration. Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt.... Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage, much of which was in Malay. This can be rather challenging, especially after coming a long ""way"" out from immigration We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter. Who knows, we must go through the same things going back. On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient. We have to endure our thirst till our flight takes off. As a tourist, the airport gives the 1st impression for passengers and how they are organized. This wasn't the kind of experience I was expecting from KLIA. Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.","I write provide feedback recent experience fly KLIA via Singapore Airlines .

"We flew with batik air. Check-in and the security checkpoint took minutes. Be aware that batik air seems to weigh your carry-on before boarding, and some people were stopped presumably to pay extra money for going over the maximum weight. Interestingly enough, even though we also went over our limit, they let us pass without paying. It feels inefficient for each gate to have its own security checkpoint, and it was confusing on whether we were boarding or not.","We fly batik air . Check-in security checkpoint take minute .

"I recently traveled through KLIA and was quite disappointed with the overall experience. The ground staff were uncooperative and extremely slow it took me 45 minutes just to drop my luggage, which is unacceptable for a major international airport. There was a clear lack of urgency and coordination among the staff, which caused unnecessary delays and frustration. The immigration process was no better. Officers were more engaged in chatting among themselves than assisting travelers. When it came to the facial recognition scan, there was no clear instruction on when to stop looking into the camera, leading to confusion and further hold-ups. Such negligence and poor communication from immigration staff are not what you'd expect from a facility that aims to be a gateway to the country. Overall, KLIA seriously needs to step up its service standards. Staff training, efficiency, and customer interaction must be improved if the airport wants to compete with other major international hubs. I hope the management takes these issues seriously and implements changes soon.","I recently travel KLIA quite disappointed overall experience .

Nice place big and spacious. Parking is a bit confusing so always park at Preferred parking to avoid looking for a car. Long walk to the bus upon arrival as the train is not ready.

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through a mall to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 PM, which was also the listed departure time, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia.","This make never want come back Malaysia . Who design place ? !

"Worst immigration experience in international airports compared to other major transit airports in Asia i.e Dubai, Doha, Istanbul and Bangkok airports. Immigration in the country took more than 1.5 hours and system was down so they had to do manual entries. On the way back. It took more than 2 hours. I had to request few people to let go of their turn so that I don't miss my flight. Only one counter for a queue of about 50 people. There was this lady at the counter. She took more than 30 mins on one couple! FGS either accept or reject. Very un progressional behavior by the immigration staff. This long wait made me miss my visit to chocolate shops as only 20 mins were left after the immigration clears. Moreover, for international departures you have to take a bus to another lounge. Which is weird for such a developed country. The hops inside are nice and many food options are available. Mosque is available on 3rd level. Have to search for it or ask for directions from the staff.

"Welcome to KLIA2 (Terminal 2), one of the 2 terminal of KL International Airport - the proud home of AirAsia and every traveler who thought budget travel just meant a cheap ticket, not a 1.2km hike from immigration to Gate J22.

Need retail therapy at 3 a.m.? Youre in luck. Need a quiet seat with a charging port? Hah, good luck. Stat corner: Opened in 2014 to replace the low-cost LCCT terminal, KLIA2 is the largest purpose-built terminal for low-cost carriers in the world. Its also a maze where time and boarding calls are mere suggestions.

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member, who was shouting, to proceed to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall. Was thinking that perhaps our flight was scheduled to park in a further lot due to multiple flights arriving around the same time. Personally, I wasnt expecting to go through the hassle of having to transit from the plane to the arrival hall, taking into consideration that this was a direct flight. Anyway, still went with the flow and follow those in front since we are told to.... This information could easily be missed if people are talking or focused on finding the nearest toilet. Although the airport was large and packed with lots of shops and eateries, there are areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving/departure passengers. Would suggest the following improvements: * Rather than having a staff member shouting/giving instructions, can consider placing clear, large signage on both sides of the walkway as passengers disembark. * Provide more readily available information upon flight arrival / departure. * Consider adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Clear directional signs and information would make a big difference for first-time visitors like myself and would save a lot of time especially when there are so many incoming/outgoing flights day to day..... The signage for the bus transfer was unclear, and it took approximately 4-5 minutes to find the waiting point to queue for the feeder bus to the arrival hall. Upon arriving at the arrival hall, it was another 2-minute walk to reach immigration. The area was extremely crowded, with queues of 2-3 lines in a row, resulting in an hour-long wait to clear immigration. The process was very disorganized and messy, with no one managing the human traffic, possibly due to a shortage of manpower. Although the officers were friendly and efficient in clearing the queue, it would be beneficial to have crowd control/security to guide and manage the flow of passengers. Locating the correct baggage belt after clearing immigration was another challenge. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts, requiring passengers to walk near the belt to check the monitor screen. This was frustrating, especially with different groups of people surrounding the area, some looking for directions, some waiting for friends, and others searching for the right belt. We eventually found our luggage placed not far away from the luggage belt area near the exit, with a sign displaying the SQ Airlines logo on the floor. Many unclaimed bags from our flight were present, as most passengers were still stuck in immigration. The entire process, from disembarking the plane to retrieving our luggage outside the baggage claim area, was challenging. I thought we were only required to transit to the arrival hall as a one-time occurrence. However, on our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient. As a tourist, the airport gives the first impression for passengers, and its organization is crucial. I hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements","I write provide feedback recent experience fly KLIA via Singapore Airlines .

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling. This looks fancy but very old school. Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating Very confusing direction or procedure. I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products. Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority. As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go. Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there.

"Nice airport, efficient good signage. Attentive staff also at security. But... can the air conditioning please be a bit less intense?

"One of the worst airport experiences Ive ever had. While the airport is spacious, the design is extremely confusing. Each level has two separate sides, and if you accidentally end up on the wrong one, you have to go back up and re-enter from another point theres no direct way to cross over. The terminals are connected by trains, but shockingly, youre charged 2 MYR per person just to use them! Shuttle buses are available, but only from specific areas that take at least 30 minutes of walking to reach, with no clear guidance. There are no proper information desks, and youre left to ask random staff who often give vague or conflicting directions. To make matters worse, baggage trolley staff were communicating using loud whistles it was chaotic and very unpleasant. The AirAsia terminal (2) was particularly bad and felt extremely disorganized. This experience alone is enough to make me reconsider visiting Malaysia again just to avoid going through this airport.","One bad experience Ive ever . While spacious , design extremely confusing .

"We were traveling with our 9 month kid and had a 6 hours stay, so we were carrying a baby mat for kid to crawl on and sit to avoid accidentally hitting his head on tiled floor. A person from airport authority came and said we can't do that as it looks bad for the airport and asked us to fold our mat and go, sit on chairs instead l. No one had any issues a month back when we did the same at the same spot. When asked to call someone we can have a proper discussion about it the person told us to go to information desk and had no further information regarding policies etc. and meanwhile he was clicking pictures. We told him that the baby change rooms are dirty , not maintained and smells bad, he should clock pictures of that and do something about it maybe and he said you can book a room if you have problem with the cleanliness. Not traveling to this airport ever again.","We travel 9 month kid 6 hour stay , carry baby mat kid crawl sit avoid accidentally hit head tiled floor .

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers. These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member to go to C15 for a transfer to the arrival hall. Rather having a staff to shout ,wouldn't it be better to put up clear large signage at both side of the walk way while we disembark? The signage for this bus transfer was also unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus. Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldnt it be better to have basic international standard too? Situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall. The area was extremely crowded,people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration. Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic which leads to all these mess. After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for. The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when yiu have different groups of people surrounding the area....some was waiting for their friends while some was was looking for the right belt for their luggage. Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right. We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the Singapore Airlines logo on the floor. Quite a handful of luggage was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight were still stuck in immigration. Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt. Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage much of which was in Malay. This can be rather challenging, especially after a series of such ""events"" we went through. We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter, who knows we must go through the same things going back. On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.We have to endure our thirst till our flight take off. As a tourist, I dont enjoy it if I have to go through so much hassle. This was one of a kind of experience i wasn't expecting from KLIA... Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.","I write provide feedback recent experience fly KLIA via Singapore Airlines .

"The organization is good, in departure mode, although there are few travelers. On the other hand, it's dirty and somewhat rundown. At the boarding gates, it's stifling, crowded together on dirty seats. People are outrageous and unruly. The restrooms are okay. Lack of modernity compared to the modernism displayed in downtown Kuala Lumpur. Needs interior design. I didn't expect it to be like Singapore airport, but better nonetheless. In arrival mode, it's indeed confusing where are the luggage??? And if you're arriving from a two-hour flight and have a jet lag, it's very complicated. Nothing or very little is written. The taxis are all waiting to take you and charge you 30 to get to the center; I'm surprised they pay that price.

"The airport looks very fancy and all - at least Terminal 1. It is very unorganized though. We arrived extremely late from our first flight (thank you batik air) and only had 15-20min items to get our connecting flight. Normally airports would provide a shuttle services, picking you from a gate to bring you to your connecting flight in time. This was not the case here, we were only told the gate number of our connecting flight, which after running to for 10min, turned out to be the wrong gate. So instead we had to take the bus to another terminal, which obviously did not give us enough time to catch our flight, so we were stuck in KL for 1 night. Additionally it is ridiculous, that there is no smoking area in the entirety of terminal 1. So if you are stuck here for a while you have to go all the way to terminal 2, into one of the most disgusting smoking rooms Ive witnessed in my life (no ventilation at all, might as well just walk in and breath twice and youve already passively smoked a carton of cigarettes). Really disappointing for such a modern (only t1) and large airport.","The look fancy - least Terminal 1 . It unorganized though .

"Arriving: Immigration for arrivals took too long! The officers works so slowly and the poor internet connection in this area is not helping either. It took us long enough to complete immigration to the point that our bags were no longer in the conveyor belt/shown on screen. Pick up location of ride hailing (Grab) was easy at Level 1. Departure: Check in counters are spread out making it not too crowded/congested. Immigration for departure is quicker and easier. However, there's a security screening for customs departure that was separated with at-gate security check. I would say this is very inefficient as you need to check your bags twice and once you have cleared security you practically cannot go out to the retail area. In addition, the post-security gate is a nightmare with neither water stations nor proper toilet! There seems to be no signs of priority boarding based on group but rather by seats (not sure if this is an MH or KLIA problem). Retail space is decent with great tax-free goods options and decent restaurant selections. One thing to appreciate: the toilets (in retail & public) areas are clean and equipped with jet showers.","Arriving : Immigration arrival take long !

"Exhausting.. you need to have atleast a year of airport work experience to just transit through this airport. It took nearly 2 hrs from landing to sitting down at our gate. So much is automated and so few staff members to help. So many more hurdles to jump such as filling in an MDAC, yes, we were asked to fill it in on-line at Siem Reap, but thought it couldn't possibly be for us as so many 'mandatory' boxes were irrelevant to us. However, at the airport, they insisted we filled it in with a bunch of false information, i.e. the address where we would be staying (had to put in an they address provided.. which was the airport's address) a waste of time, as we felt we could miss our connecting flight. We also had to create our own baggage tags, then TWO separate baggage screenings - so unnecessary. So many options of queues without clear instructions, so many people, so much walking - just seems chaotic. Not my favourite airport.","Exhausting .. need atleast year work experience transit .

But the thing that annoyed the most, was the lack of transparency regarding the newly introduced MDAC that every foreigner needs to fill in. About 20% of the people in the queue wait for a long time, and then when coming to the immigration officer they did not fill in the MDAC and the foreigner is redirected to the back again to fill it in. It is a waste of time for people waiting, the immigration officers and for the people who did not fill it in. It is very simple, put some signage to be clear at the start of the queue. ""Did you fill in your MDAC?"". If not, fill it in first. I literally filled it in in 2 minutes while I was in the long queue. Sure, everyone needs to do their own research.

"I was assaulted by a female airport customer experience officer who attempted to physically restrain me without justification. When I demanded to file a police report, I was told I would have to go to Terminal 2something my Australian emergency passport did not permit. Despite my repeated requests, the airport police refused to take my report and instead escorted me to the immigration department. There, I was met by an aggressive and unprofessional immigration officer named Kamarudin. When I asked for his full name in writing, he refused and rudely pointed to his name badge, telling me to take a photo with my phone. The moment I did, he became enraged and began intimidating meeven going so far as to take photos of me and my passport on his personal phone. This was a blatant violation of privacy and professional conduct. **Malaysias airport authorities and immigration officers behaved in a disgusting, abusive, and unaccountable manner. Travelers beware: AVOID MALAYSIA at all costs!** **Legal Analysis** This conduct raises multiple violations under Malaysian law: 1. **Assault and Criminal Force (Penal Code Sections 350-352)** The staff member's actions in grabbing my arms and physically restraining me without consent constitutes criminal force under Section 350. Case precedent (PP v. Mohd Anuar bin Abdullah [1994] 2 MLJ 261) confirms that any intentional use of force without lawful justification meets this threshold. 2. **Wrongful Confinement (Penal Code Section 340)** The unlawful restriction of my movement within the clinic treatment room amounts to wrongful confinement. Malaysian jurisprudence establishes that detention without legal authority is punishable, particularly where no legitimate lien exists over the person. 3. **Official Misconduct** The behavior of Immigration Officer Kamarudin in: - Failing to properly address a criminal complaint - Intimidating a complainant - Improper use of personal devices to photograph sensitive documents May constitute offenses under Malaysia's official misconduct provisions. UPDATE: Malaysian Airport Management have promised a full investigation of this matter however no official response as of yet.","I assault female customer experience officer attempt physically restrain without justification .

When we pass through the check point the handle bag (I don't know what for) but then have another check point to gate P! after we go through we saw that our gate changed to gate Q which it's in another side of the building.

"What happened to KLIA? I loved this airport. It was clean, friendly, quick and easy to get through. But the past few times it was horrible: long lines, unfriendly and unhelpful staff, angry travelers, expensive food (yes, more expensive) and more. Toilets are overal dirty too. Travelers are also unfriendly and loud. Not KLIAs fault, but nobody seems to care. Cellphones everywhere playing all kind of videos, loud phone calls, and playing music that's just horrible. The rain forest thing seems a joke to me. Nice idea, but its advertised as if its huge. It's not, its small. Nice view through a window inside it, because it was closed and I have no idea if its normally open to enter. When I went through security it felt to easy, and it was. It seems gates have a second security point. No clear lines, no communication, and everyone is pushing and pulling to get through. Staff dont seem to care. I almost missed my flight because there were 4 lines for 1 gate and nobody knew who could go through. Add some clear lines or something. Two positive things: arriving is pretty simple and quick. And when leaving I know I will be in a plane at some point.","What happen KLIA ? I love . It clean , friendly , quick easy get .

"One of the worst airport experiences Ive ever had. While the airport is spacious, the design is extremely confusing. Each level has two separate sides, and if you accidentally end up on the wrong one, you have to go back up and re-enter from another point theres no direct way to cross over. The terminals are connected by trains, but shockingly, youre charged 2 MYR per person just to use them! Shuttle buses are available, but only from specific areas that take at least 30 minutes of walking to reach, with no clear guidance. There are no proper information desks, and youre left to ask random staff who often give vague or conflicting directions. To make matters worse, baggage trolley staff were communicating using loud whistles it was chaotic and very unpleasant. The AirAsia terminal (2) was particularly bad and felt extremely disorganized. This experience alone is enough to make me reconsider visiting Malaysia again just to avoid going through this airport.","One bad experience Ive ever . While spacious , design extremely confusing .

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, ""because it's too late now to buy tickets"" (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid almost triple the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. And also, the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration! I had such a hard time to book the Grab taxi and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, in any airport that's when wifi is needed!! But here there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!! I've never had this much hastle and wasted time to manage to exit an airport, oh yeah, and the airport is so far away from the city it took us 90 minutes to reach the hotel (with zero traffic after midnight) knowing this, the designers still decided to add a mall to make your trip even slower! This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia. I've never thought an airport would affect my will to visit a country but here we are.","This make never want come back Malaysia . Who design place ? !

"Extremely Poor Experience with Malaysia Airlines and Airport Authority Ive been standing in queue for over 2 hours, and the situation is completely mismanaged. All departing flights are being funneled through a single security gate, creating chaos, overcrowding, and confusion. Security lines are excessively long. Departure gates are closed with passengers still stuck in queues. Malaysia Airlines staff have been unhelpful and, in some cases, outright rude. No clear communication or assistance provided to stressed travelers. This experience reflects a serious lack of coordination between Malaysia Airlines and airport authorities.

"A more than bad experience... I arrived at the airport at 7:00 AM, and went directly to wrap my large bag. There were only two people in front of me, but the wrapping took longer than expected. When I got to the baggage check-in counter, I found the queue very long, and my turn didn't come until 8:15 AM!!! The flight gate opened... When I finished, I didn't know where to go to find the gate, so I asked one of the employees, and her response was very... When she left, she started mocking me in front of the shop owners, as she imitated the way I spoke in front of them. I didn't have time to stop her because this is a disrespectful way to treat tourists and guests in general... Anyway, when I finally got to the bus stop, I found another queue, and we went to the bus, thank God... But the surprise was that there was another inspection before boarding the plane!!!! This caused the backlog and queues again!!!! One of the worst airport experiences in my life. Unprofessional and slow employees, poor airport management and organization. Finally, the plane didn't take off after this chaos until half an hour after the official takeoff time, and I was forced to stand during these three hours because of the boring and tiring queues. A bad experience by all standards.","A bad experience ... I arrive 7:00 AM , go directly wrap large bag . There two people front , wrapping take long expect .

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was shockingly poor and has completely soured my view of Malaysia. Arriving late at night, I was met with an appalling three-hour wait in the immigration queue. With only two counters open, the already tired and frustrated passengers were subjected to rude and unprofessional behavior from the immigration officers. One officer, who identified himself as Nizam, was particularly aggressive, yelling at passengers and making demeaning comments about their attempts to use the biometric scanners. His dismissive attitude and condescending tone were echoed by other staff members, creating a hostile and uncomfortable atmosphere for everyone, including families with young children. The situation worsened when, due to the extensive delay, our luggage was removed from the baggage carousel. This added further stress and inconvenience to an already exhausting experience. It felt as though the immigration staff treated their positions as some sort of celebrity status, rather than a service role. The impact of this disastrous airport experience rippled through my entire trip. I had to cancel some planned tourist attractions due to the excessive wait times I encountered elsewhere, including another two-hour queue. My children were exhausted, and our holiday was ultimately ruined. As if the airport ordeal wasn't enough, our tourist vehicle was later stopped by police for a seemingly pointless immigration check, resulting in another hour-long delay. This unnecessary display of authority felt like a final insult. It's ironic that Malaysia's economy relies heavily on tourism, yet visitors are treated with such disrespect. This entire experience was so negative that I will never visit Malaysia again. It's truly a shame, as I had hoped for a much more positive experience.","My recent experience Kuala Lumpur International Airport shockingly poor completely sour view Malaysia .

"Chaotic. We flew British Airways business class and it wasn't clear that we needed to go to gate G1, downstairs and take a bus to C gates, where Golden Lounge is. We walked around the main terminal being sent in random directions before being told the right information. At check in, we should have been told go to Gate G1 and take a bus. The Golden Lounge was very large. The bar is right near the entrance, so sit near there if you want to have a drink or two. Obviously the serving of alcohol is controlled here. I ordered two sparkling wines; one for my partner too but I was only served one. I had to ask for the second one and I felt judged for doing so. The glasses were small and the wine wasn't good. There was lots of hot food choices; far more than any other business lounge I have been too. Sandwiches, pasta and noodles made to order. Lots of other self-serve foods too. Don't try to take any drinks from the lounge, as you aren't allowed to take any onboard from this airport.","Chaotic .

KLIA really needs updating.

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers. These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member to go to C15 for a transfer to the arrival hall. Rather having a staff to shout ,wouldn't it be better to put up clear signage at both side of the walk way while we disembark? The signage for this bus transfer was unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus. Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldnt it be better to have basic international standard too? Situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall. The area was extremely crowded,people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration. Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic which leads to all these mess. After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for. The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when yiu have different groups of people surrounding the area....some was waiting for their friends while some was was looking for the right belt for their luggage. Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right. We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the Singapore Airlines logo on the floor. Quite a handful of luggage was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight were still stuck in immigration. Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt. Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage much of which was in Malay. This can be rather challenging, especially after a series of such ""events"" we went through. We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter, who knows we must go through the same things going back. On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.We have to endure our thirst till our flight take off. As a tourist, I dont enjoy it if I have to go through so much hassle. This was one of a kind of experience i wasn't expecting from KLIA... Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.","I write provide feedback recent experience fly KLIA via Singapore Airlines .

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling. This looks fancy but very old school. Restaurant not enough air con at night time.

I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products. Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate when leaving from KL to overseas.

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was unfortunately extremely disappointing. Firstly, the staff were generally unfriendly and appeared to have minimal understanding of English, which made basic communication difficult to impossible. More critically, there was a noticeable general incompetence across various functions. Staff seemed unable or unwilling to perform their duties, such as overseeing passengers and maintaining order in the queues. In this context, I repeatedly observed an absolute lack of professional supervision, where people were simply allowed to cut in line or where queues dissolved into chaos without any staff intervention. An additional major point of inefficiency was the self-service process: I was directed to the scanner by immigration staff, only for the scanner to then instruct me to return to the immigration counter, causing further unnecessary delays and frustration. Furthermore, the signage (wayfinding) was poor, often unclear, and lacked sufficient repetition throughout the terminal, making navigation difficult. To top it all off, there was also a lack of seating at the airport itself, and the seats that were available were often taken up by a single person lying down across three seats, leaving people who wanted to sit with nowhere to go. This combination of poor (and by times even disrespectful) customer service, language barriers, failure to enforce basic operational procedures and the lack of seating led to unnecessary stress and delays. It's clear that KLIA urgently needs to invest in significantly better training for its personnel, focusing on customer service, language proficiency, and core job efficiency. If I could give 0 stars, I would!","My recent experience Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) unfortunately extremely disappointing .

"My second trip through Kuala Lumpur International Airport was unfortunately just as frustrating as the first. The customer service here is a huge problem. I asked multiple staff members for help with basic info, and every single one just shrugged, said ""I don't know"" and acted like it wasn't their job. There was zero effort to even try and find out. It's truly baffling. Then there's the internal airport bus with no proper monitoring. We had our 5-month-old with us and we literally had to stand for a 5-minute ride between gates. The bus wasn't even packed but everyone was too busy hogging their spot to offer one up to someone struggling with a baby. The fear of losing balance and dropping our infant was terrifying. People just sat there watching us, completely uncaring. To top it off, we saw a couple of electric buggies nearby, clearly for passenger assistance, but there was no one to drive them! We asked four different staff if they could help us get one, and each time, we got the same clueless ""I don't know"" response. For an international airport, the lack of basic help and common courtesy is really poor. Traveling with a baby is already tough enough, and KLIA just made it worse. I'll definitely be trying to avoid this airport next time.","My second trip Kuala Lumpur International Airport unfortunately frustrating first . The customer service huge problem .

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through a mall to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 PM, which was also the listed departure time, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia.","This make never want come back Malaysia . Who design place ? !

"Departure terminals are a nightmare, the airline check in desks are facing away from the main hall and the screens dont guide you to the right check in lane. Poor direction.

"I visited Malaysia recently to attend a concert. I queued at immigration for almost two hours. When it was my turn, the officer did not smile or greet me back, despite my polite greeting. She only said Ticket? without explaining further. I showed my concert ticket, but she gave no response and told me to go back and queue again. I explained that I had already waited for over an hour, but she insisted without reason. Her tone and facial expressions were unfriendly, making my first impression of Malaysia very disappointing. Eventually, I showed all my documents and was allowed to pass. However, her attitude left a negative memory of the trip. I hope the management can provide proper training to ensure visitors are treated with courtesy.","I visit Malaysia recently attend concert . I queue immigration almost two hour .

"Ive traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always stood out for its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, is a beautiful highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of foreign and unique local offerings. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its due- the new bathrooms are a massive improvement! Well-designed, clean, and dry. But I cant ignore the disappointing shift in retail and dining options. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. Also why is alcohol and tobacco taking up a large portion of the retail space every time? I was shocked to find only one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a foodie havenwhy isnt KLIA showcasing its rich culinary heritage and diversity? Gone are the great local options that once served authentic dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles and teh tarik. Instead, global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans dominate the F&B spaces. Surely, theres room for more homegrown eateries that represent Malaysias incredible food culture? To add to the frustration, the monorail is still not working, and travelers have to rely on shuttle buses- slow and less efficient. And when I asked an Ask Me For Help staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phonecustomer service should be better than this. KLIA, we can do better! Support local businesses and bring back the true Malaysian experience.","Ive travel KLIA countless time year , always stand cleanliness , smooth check-in process , efficient security check .

"It might be more appropriate to call it Kuala Lumpur Airport rather than 'International.' While the airport is generally clean and well-lit, the transit area is underwhelming. Wi-Fi connectivity is slow, and there are limited food and retail options. A significant upgrade or expansion is needed if the airport aims to keep up with other regional hubs. Additionally, the transport pick-up experience at Terminal 2 was a nightmare. The poorly designed two-lane pick-up area created severe congestion, and we ended up waiting over an hour just to be picked up. It's unclear who was responsible for this layout, but it clearly needs a serious rethink","It might appropriate call Kuala Lumpur Airport rather 'International .

I was so heartbroken to hear these questions which the first officer could have asked me at the first place. I told the officer at the immigration about this whole scenario and she was shocked by herself and told me that she should not have sent me here and ask these questions by herself. Literally ruined my whole day almost 11 hours at the airport. Really disappointed because i was not expecting this kind of behaviour by a country which i was very excited to visit. If my review finds any person in charge please look into this matter. I know there are people who enters the country for illegal purposes like slipping or so but what about the legit tourists?

"If you can avoid using this airport I would suggest in doing so. I have been in and out of KL a few times and each time has been a terrible experience. You will be charged fees you dont need to pay, wait in long queues and be sent to multiple stations around the airport. One particularly notable time recently was I waited so long to check in my baggage and we had told the staff our flight was soon. When I finally arrived at the counter the woman was fussing about. I asked her five times if there was an issue, and after ignoring me all those times she eventually told me my flight was boarding, so Id have to take the next flight. Once I asked her what the next time was she said 5pm, this meant I would have been stranded in Thailand with no accommodation as I needed to get a boat to where I was going. The last boat was at 6pm. After having multiple arguments with the staff a lovely man did escort us to our gate. There have honestly been multiple issues similarly at this airport, with unhelpful staff. This is coming from someone who is more than happy and patient to wait!","If avoid use I would suggest . I KL time time terrible experience .

"For such a major international hub, the airport felt a little confusing and chaotic. We ran into the same issue two times - once on arrival (for transit) and once for departure. During arrival we wanted to switch from C Gates to A/B gates for domestic departure but it was confusing to find the directions. Exactly at the same location, during departure, we had to switch to C gates but got confused. We later realised that one of the sign boards is actually wrong. It points to an escalator upwards that goes into the shopping area. Whereas the C gates entry is exactly in the opposite direction of the sign. For an international airport this is not acceptable at all. I dont have photos, but getting confused at the same place two times is not right. We saw a few others get confused too. Apart from that there is no major security check and body scan before immigration. However this is done prior to boarding. This is not as per standard processes elsewhere wherein the detailed security check and body scan is done immediately at entry. Somehow disappointed with the airport.","For major international hub , felt little confusing chaotic . We run issue two time - arrival ( transit ) departure .

"KLIA is so huge, the potential clinical coldness of the facility is cleverly softened with what appears to be an atrium of greenery. The once state of the art facilities of this Airport is marred by the breakdown of the Aerotrain system that used to provide a world class service between the terminals. The Aerotrain gates have been hidden behind dark but colourful hoarding. Opposite the hoarding are lines of waiting passengers queuing to enter the various B gates, together with their various hand carry items. With poor lighting due to the height of the dark colourd hoarding, this creates a somewhat long dark narrow somber passage that arriving visitors to Malaysia must navigate to reach the escalators to the ground level and transfer bus terminal. Any negative impressions arising from negotiating past the queuing passengers with unsettled infants and the ocassional unrestrained child darting into the crowd flow is further accentuated as one reaches the ground level and confronted by the multinational crowd chaos at the Satellite Terminal bus transfer gate. The airport employees manning the area do a great job in moving the crowd in arbitrary groups onto the waiting buses. Despite the apparent crowd chaos, these Malaysian employees at various informal ""gates"" manage to prevent a crowd surge and create controlled access on to the buses. These lowly front line employees are the true heroes in this situation and are living examples of the ""Malaysia Boleh"" can-do attitude. It's such a pity senior Airport management doesn't display a similar level of commitment in getting the Aerotrain system fixed and creating a positive first impression for international arrivals to Malaysia.","KLIA huge , potential clinical coldness facility cleverly soften appear atrium greenery .

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member, who was shouting, to proceed to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall by bus. Was thinking that perhaps our flight was scheduled to park in a further lot due to multiple flights arriving around the same time,which requires us to do a short transit. Personally, I wasnt expecting to go through the hassle of having to transit from the plane to the arrival hall, taking into consideration that this was a direct flight. Anyway, still went with the flow and follow those in front since we are told to.... This information could easily be missed if people are talking or focused on finding the nearest toilet. Although the airport was large and packed with lots of shops and eateries, there are areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving/departure passengers. Would suggest the following improvements: * Rather than having a staff member shouting/giving instructions, can consider placing clear, large signage on both sides of the walkway as passengers disembark. * Provide more readily available information upon flight arrival / departure. * Consider adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Clear directional signs and information would make a big difference for first-time visitors like myself and would save a lot of time especially when there are so many incoming/outgoing flights day to day..... The signage for the bus transfer was unclear, and it took approximately 4-5 minutes to find the waiting point to queue for the feeder bus to the arrival hall. Upon arriving at the arrival hall, it was another 2-minute walk to reach immigration. The area was extremely crowded, with queues of 2-3 lines in a row, resulting in an hour-long wait to clear immigration. The process was very disorganized and messy, with no one managing the human traffic, possibly due to a shortage of manpower. Although the officers were friendly and efficient in clearing the queue, it would be beneficial to have crowd control/security to guide and manage the flow of passengers. Locating the correct baggage belt after clearing immigration was another challenge. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts, requiring passengers to walk near the belt to check the monitor screen. This was frustrating, especially with different groups of people surrounding the area, some looking for directions, some waiting for friends, and others searching for the right belt. We eventually found our luggage placed not far away from the luggage belt area near the exit, with a sign displaying the SQ Airlines logo on the floor. Many unclaimed bags from our flight were present, as most passengers were still stuck in immigration. The entire process, from disembarking the plane to retrieving our luggage outside the baggage claim area, was challenging. I thought we were only required to transit to the arrival hall as a one-time occurrence. However, on our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient. As a tourist, the airport gives the first impression for passengers, and its organization is crucial. I hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements","I write provide feedback recent experience fly KLIA via Singapore Airlines .

This information could easily miss people talk focus find near toilet . Although large pack lot shop eatery , area could improve facilitate smooth transit arriving/departure passenger . Would suggest following improvement : * Rather staff member shouting/giving instruction , consider place clear , large signage side walkway passenger disembark . * Provide readily available information upon flight arrival / departure . * Consider adjust volume announcement speaker loud clear information English , Chinese , Malay . Clear directional sign information would make big difference first-time visitor like would save lot time especially many incoming/outgoing flight day day ..... The signage bus transfer unclear , take approximately 4-5 minute find wait point queue feeder bus arrival hall . Upon arrive arrival hall , another 2-minute walk reach immigration . The area extremely crowd , queue 2-3 line row , result hour-long wait clear immigration . The process disorganized messy , one manage human traffic , possibly due shortage manpower . Although officer friendly efficient clear queue , would beneficial crowd control/security guide manage flow passenger . Locating correct baggage belt clear immigration another challenge . The area crowd , three four luggage belt , require passenger walk near belt check monitor screen . This frustrate , especially different group people surround area , look direction , wait friend , others search right belt . We eventually find luggage place far away luggage belt area near exit , sign display SQ Airlines logo floor . Many unclaimed bag flight present , passenger still stick immigration . The entire process , disembark plane retrieve luggage outside baggage claim area , challenge . I think require transit arrival hall one-time occurrence . However , return flight , require take short bus departure hall . Furthermore , water dispenser available pass inspection gate , inconvenient .

"I rarely give 1-star reviews, but this airport truly deserves it. The boarding process is poor. The security machines are outdated and the taxis are old and dirty, showing no signs of improvement in decades. Even the so-called premium taxis are worse than budget taxis in many other countries. After a post-COVID renovation, they still use manual water taps. Isnt contactless supposed to matter after COVID? Hard to believe this place gets 4 or 5 stars.","I rarely give 1-star review , truly deserve . The boarding process poor . The security machine outdated taxi old dirty , show sign improvement decade .

"Extremely Poor Experience with Malaysia Airlines and Airport Authority Ive been standing in queue for over 2 hours, and the situation is completely mismanaged. All departing flights are being funneled through a single security gate, creating chaos, overcrowding, and confusion. Security lines are excessively long. Departure gates are closed with passengers still stuck in queues. Malaysia Airlines staff have been unhelpful and, in some cases, outright rude. No clear communication or assistance provided to stressed travelers. This experience reflects a serious lack of coordination between Malaysia Airlines and airport authorities. I strongly advise others to avoid flying with MYA until basic service and operational standards are improved.","Extremely Poor Experience Malaysia Airlines Airport Authority Ive stand queue 2 hour , situation completely mismanage .

"I had a deeply frustrating and disappointing experience at Kuala Lumpur Airport due to the unprofessionalism and rudeness of the staff. Upon arrival, I realized I had accidentally left my luggage in the restroom near the baggage claim. When I approached the information desk to ask for help, I received conflicting and unhelpful instructions. Some staff told me to go to the second floor, while others asked me to use an invalid boarding pass to re-enter security (which was impossible since my ticket was for a domestic flight from Kota Kinabalu). I ended up running back and forth between the second and third floors more than ten times, but no one took responsibility or provided any real assistance. Desperate, I approached a female staff member at the exit to request her help in checking the restroom for my luggage. Not only was she extremely reluctant, but she also glared at me in a hostile manner. After being persuaded by her colleague, she finally went to check the restroom. Within less than a minute, she came back and coldly told me my luggage wasnt there, claiming to have confirmed with the cleaning staff. However, this was simply not possible. Two hours later, left with no other options, I asked a passenger who hadnt exited yet to help me check the restroom. In just three minutes, they returned with my luggage. This experience was utterly unacceptable. The staffs lack of professionalism, unwillingness to help, and outright rudeness made an already stressful situation even worse. An airport should prioritize assisting passengers, not adding to their frustration. I hope the management will take serious steps to train their staff to ensure such incidents dont happen again.","I deeply frustrating disappointing experience Kuala Lumpur Airport due unprofessionalism rudeness staff .

"Unfortunately, my experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was disappointing. Here are a few points that struck me negatively: 1. Strict baggage control, but not consistent: My hand luggage was accurately weighed, and even though it was only slightly over 7kg, I was told to pay extra. At the same time, the Malaysian woman in front of me, weighing almost 8 kg, was allowed to walk away - that felt unfair. 2. Poor Signage: Some gates had no numbers, which was extremely confusing. It was difficult to find the right path. 3. Lack of seating: There were no seats at the gate, which made the wait unnecessarily tiring. 4. Inadequate Toilets: The women's restrooms were a mess - I waited in line for over 30 minutes and when it was finally my turn, they were dirty. The men apparently had enough toilets as there were no queues. Last but not least, our flight was delayed.

My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority. As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go. Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there. I went other less modern airport like ho chi Ming city or in Istanbul.

"KLIA1 has undergone a number of upgrades in the past couple of years, particularly in terms of dining options on Level 5's Departure Hall (before security/immigration control) and duty-free shopping (after security/immigration control) in the main terminal. Work is still ongoing and hopefully we'll continue to see improvements in the months to come. My main problem with KLIA1 is the absence of any water refill stations at the passenger waiting area (boarding gates) after security clearance. Being a frequent flyer who's flown in and out of so many airports around the world, KLIA1 remains the only big airport that doesn't have this facility made available to passengers. I don't understand why the airport just doesn't address this issue as it's causing passengers (e.g., parents, senior travellers, etc.) so much inconvenience. Once passengers clears security, they won't access to any drinking water until they board their flight. Surely this is a shortcoming that can be easily fixed by the airport administrator...yet it remains the same month after month after month. @KLA1 - If you see this review, please provide some water refill stations for the convenience and comfort of your passengers.

"Worst immigration experience in international airports compared to other major transit airports in Asia i.e Dubai, Doha, Istanbul and Bangkok airports. Immigration in the country took more than 1.5 hours and system was down so they had to do manual entries. On the way back. It took more than 2 hours. I had to request few people to let go of their turn so that I don't miss my flight. Only one counter for a queue of about 50 people. There was this lady at the counter. She took more than 30 mins on one couple! FGS either accept or reject. Very un progressional behavior by the immigration staff. This long wait made me miss my visit to chocolate shops as only 20 mins were left after the immigration clears. Moreover, for international departures you have to take a bus to another lounge. Which is weird for such a developed country. The shops inside are nice and many food options are available. Mosque is available on 3rd level. Have to search for it or ask for directions from the staff. If some one wishes to connect a domestic flight directly with the international keep at least 3 hours buffer. Always book within the same literary. Keep at least 2 hours for the immigration clearance. Such a pathetic and slow service.

"I had two layovers at KLIA. The first time, everything went well: the airport was clean, well-organized, and especially a well-appointed prayer room, which is really appreciated by Muslim travelers. However, the second time was a completely different story, as if it weren't even the same place. As soon as you get off the plane, nothing is clear: there's almost no signage for baggage claim. It's easy to get lost, you don't know where to go. And then, surprise: you have to go through security and immigration before claiming your baggage. Completely illogical. At least let me collect my bag peacefully first! Once you're through immigration, you arrive in a huge crowd, with no smooth flow of traffic. Then you have to go through security again to get out. You board, you get off, you take a bus, you change buildings... frankly, a real hassle. Another point: the baggage counter agents are extremely strict, sometimes even abusive. If you weigh 5 kg more than you need, you pay, period, no flexibility. The prayer rooms? They used to be clean, now they're dilapidated, not maintained. Really a shame. Finally, I had a three-hour layover, I barely had time to navigate the obstacle course to get to my gate. And guess what? 40 minutes into the flight, our gate was changed from 35 to 4. Great. And then, as a Muslim, I felt uneasy. For a country I considered a brother, I had never felt so foreign. Clearly, Asian passengers are given priority. Sad to say, but I felt a real form of nationalism. In short, very disappointed. I didn't find the welcome I was hoping for in a country like Malaysia.","I two layover KLIA .

Instead, use Bolt for a more affordable and reliable ride. Bypass Airport Surcharges with Trains To avoid high airport ride-hailing fees, take the Express Rail Link (ERL) to Salak Tinggi station. From there, book a ride via Bolt for a significantly cheaper fare. Steer Clear of Airport Taxis Avoid taxis waiting at the airport, as they often charge exorbitant rates (RM300400). Opt for e-hailing services like Bolt, where fares to Kuala Lumpur should not exceed RM80 for a standard car or RM50 for a 4-seater. Know Your Rights with E-Hailing With e-hailing apps, pay only the fare shown in the app. If a driver demands extra payment, record their details (name, car plate number, and interaction) and report it to the nearest police station. Such behavior violates fair practices and harms Malaysias reputation. Pro Tip: Always book rides through trusted apps like Bolt for transparency and savings.

"I'm a Japanese tourist. I came on AirAsia via HIS. When I returned to Japan, I was constantly told to check in at the machine, and even when I went to the machine, I was asked for my reservation number. However, the document from HIS does not have a reservation number written on it. Therefore, even if you go to the counter again and say, ""You can't check in using the machine!"", they just insist that you ""check in using the machine."" So when I looked back at my HIS documents, I found a form that was difficult to understand and required me to show the staff in English that I couldn't check in using the machine. However, even if I showed them my English, the staff was insistent that I check in using the machine. After that, I managed to check in, but...

It just doesnt make sense. Its far too big to be an airport. The fact its also a shopping centre confuses things. You have a very long walk once you get off the flight and then have to also navigate out of the shopping centre which is confusing in itself. The way in (departing) there are queues and it is slow. Went through security once and then got water and food to then be told at the gate I cant take it through as there was another bag check. Once waiting at the gate there was no toilets. Youd think an airport of this size would then put toilets at the gate ? You can see the problem in this when you have to drink your water for the flight before you go through second round of security. Logistically the whole thing doesnt work.,It doesnt make sense .

"KLIA is an international airport that always feels like a poor budget airport that is falling apart. Ironically, it is overstaffed by an army of smiling greeters. On Sunday, 22 June 2025, we saw water dispenser stations broken and unrepaired. ""Free drinks"" stations abandoned, unmanned. The only smoking room in the airport is a filthy room covered in black soot: incredibly smelly, no ventilation systems, piles of ash, trash, and butts all over. Warning: Enter at your own risk. The aerotrain was being repaired, and although bus services were provided, no signs were available to passengers on where it is. Bus services from the sub terminal to the main terminal were not easy to find.

"Extremely Disappointed Misleading Prices and Poor Service I had a very disappointing experience at this caf in the Malaysian International Airport. The prices displayed on the product tags were already quite high, but when I went to pay, I was suddenly asked to pay more due to additional taxes that were not shown upfront. This kind of pricing is misleading and unfair, especially in an international airport where transparency should be standard. To make matters worse, when I questioned the price difference, the staff refused to give me what I had selected unless I paid the extra hidden charges. I ended up leaving without my purchase. Travelers deserve honesty, clear pricing, and respectnot surprises at the counter. I hope airport management takes this seriously and enforces proper pricing standards.

"KLIA is so huge, the potential clinical coldness of the facility is cleverly softened with what appears to be an atrium of greenery. The once state of the art facilities of this Airport is marred by the breakdown of the Aerotrain system that used to provide a world class service between the terminals. The Aerotrain gates have been hidden behind dark but colourful hoarding. Opposite the hoarding are lines of waiting passengers queuing to enter the various B gates, together with their various hand carry items. With poor lighting due to the height of the dark colourd hoarding, this creates a somewhat long dark narrow somber passage that arriving visitors to Malaysia must navigate to reach the escalators to the ground level and transfer bus terminal. Any negative impressions arising from negotiating past the queuing passengers with unsettled infants and the ocassional unrestrained child darting into the crowd flow is further accentuated as one reaches the ground level and confronted by the multinational crowd chaos at the Satellite Terminal bus transfer gate. The airport employees manning the area do a great job in moving the crowd in arbitrary groups onto the waiting buses. Despite the apparent crowd chaos, these Malaysian employees at various informal ""gates"" manage to prevent a crowd surge and create controlled access on to the buses. These lowly front line employees are the true heroes in this situation and are living examples of the ""Malaysia Boleh"" can-do attitude. It's such a pity senior Airport management doesn't display a similar level of commitment in getting the Aerotrain system fixed and creating a positive first impression for international arrivals to Malaysia.","KLIA huge , potential clinical coldness facility cleverly soften appear atrium greenery .

"Hands down the most inefficient airport Ive had the displeasure of travelling to 1. Pointless arriving early because your gate isnt available and you end up waiting on the tarmac without air conditioning. Not enough leeway between departing / arriving flights and no backup plan 2. You often arrive at the departures gate rather than arrivals and need to take a bus to arrivals / passport control, which is a waste of time. The new aerotrain has been out of action for over 2yrs with completion dates, unsurprisingly, being delayed several times. 3. If you havent already been severely frustrated by the first 2 points, wait till you arrive at passport control. Only 2 (max 3) of the booths are open and staff are slow, disinterested and have no desire to speed up the process, as though they revel in seeing their visitors suffer. This has been an issue for years with numerous local articles about it but efficiency and an improvement mindset simply does not exist in certain parts of the world.","Hands inefficient Ive displeasure travel 1 .

"I was assaulted by a female airport passenger experience officer who attempted to physically restrain me without justification. When I demanded to file a police report, I was told I would have to go to Terminal 2something my Australian emergency passport did not permit. Despite my repeated requests, the airport police refused to take my report and instead escorted me to the immigration department. There, I was met by an aggressive and unprofessional immigration officer named Kamarudin. When I asked for his full name in writing, he refused and rudely pointed to his name badge, telling me to take a photo with my phone. The moment I did, he became enraged and began intimidating meeven going so far as to take photos of me and my passport on his personal phone. This was a blatant violation of privacy and professional conduct. **Malaysias airport authorities and immigration officers behaved in a disgusting, abusive, and unaccountable manner. Travelers beware: AVOID MALAYSIA at all costs!** **Legal Analysis** This conduct raises multiple violations under Malaysian law: 1. **Assault and Criminal Force (Penal Code Sections 350-352)** The staff member's actions in grabbing my arms and physically restraining me without consent constitutes criminal force under Section 350. Case precedent (PP v. Mohd Anuar bin Abdullah [1994] 2 MLJ 261) confirms that any intentional use of force without lawful justification meets this threshold. 2. **Wrongful Confinement (Penal Code Section 340)** The unlawful restriction of my movement within the clinic treatment room amounts to wrongful confinement. Malaysian jurisprudence establishes that detention without legal authority is punishable, particularly where no legitimate lien exists over the person. 3. **Official Misconduct** The behavior of Immigration Officer Kamarudin in: - Failing to properly address a criminal complaint - Intimidating a complainant - Improper use of personal devices to photograph sensitive documents May constitute offenses under Malaysia's official misconduct provisions. UPDATE: Malaysian Airport Management have promised a full investigation of this matter however no official response as of yet.","I assault female passenger experience officer attempt physically restrain without justification .

"First and Last Time! It's my first time in Malaysia, traveling from Abu Dhabi. As a UAE resident, I take pride in the excellent regulations we have. However, I had a very disappointing experience at Kuala Lumpur Airport with a police officer named Azhar, who was checking baggage. He removed several of our items, including our shower gel, face wash, moisturizer, perfume, mouthwasher (almost finished the bottle)and even drinking water as well. My wife and I have never encountered such treatment at any airport before, and we were shocked to learn that these items are considered ""non-carryable"" on flights, the things cost more than 700 AED, very disappointed, and will never come again worst experience ever.

"I lined up to check in for my flight back to Japan more than three hours before, but I was hardly moving forward. I looked at the counter and saw that there were several windows open, but it seemed like it took a long time for each group, and it also took a long time to check the weight of my luggage. In the end, even though I arrived at the airport early, I waited in line for more than two hours before finally completing the boarding process. It took too long. I'm sure it's the airline that's taking so long, but I think they should give it a bit more thought and improve it. From there I headed to check my baggage, but normally it's done in one go, so I wonder what's going on as they check it three times here. I think they should do it more efficiently.","I line check flight back Japan three hour , I hardly move forward .

"Worst airport I've ever been to!!! Check-in/baggage drop took forever (despite online check-in) and there were also very long queues at the passport controls. So definitely plan plenty of time. We were there over 3 hours earlier, but in the end it was very close. There are few signs and information boards in the airport. DANGER!!! The absolute shame is the controls in front of the individual gates (no information about them beforehand). AFTER going through the duty free shop area, you will have to go through security checkpoints again and drink/throw away all of the liquids you purchased there. You even have to destroy the water you bought for the flight. In the area between security check and the plane there is no longer any possibility to buy drinks/food (nor any possibility to refill your empty bottle with water) or to go to the toilet. When I asked where I could get something to drink, all I got was an annoyed Buy in Plane. For a city like Kuala Lumpur, this airport is an absolute disgrace.","Worst I 've ever ! ! !

"The airport looks very fancy and all - at least Terminal 1. It is very unorganized though. We arrived extremely late from our first flight (thank you batik air) and only had 15-20min to get our connecting flight. Normally airports would provide a shuttle services, picking you from a gate to bring you to your connecting flight in time. This was not the case here, we were only told the gate number of our connecting flight, which after running to for 10min, turned out to be the wrong gate. So instead we had to take the bus to another terminal, which obviously did not give us enough time to catch our flight, so we were stuck in KL for 1 night. Additionally it is ridiculous, that there is no smoking area in the entirety of terminal 1. So if you are stuck here for a while you have to go all the way to terminal 2, into one of the most disgusting smoking rooms Ive witnessed in my life (no ventilation at all, might as well just walk in and breath twice and youve already passively smoked a carton of cigarettes). Really disappointing for such a modern (only t1) and large airport.","The look fancy - least Terminal 1 . It unorganized though .

"Worst transit experience ever. The lounge and gate areas are chilled to fridge temperature You cant even go to the bathroom, because they are either closed for cleaning (but no one is cleaning) or they are open, but guarded by a cleaner who will follow you to the toilet and will wait outside the door to clean up right after. I dont know about others but to me this feels extremely uncomfortable. Very few public seating areas (only near the center) and they are not lit and very dark. Air has a strong kerosine smell to it. Has security checks directly at the gate (at least for our flight). The quests there are looooooooong and they use older scanners (electronics need to be taken out, watches and belts need to be taken off, ), which makes everyone take an incredibly long time to go through the screening.

I have got a bad experience with this airport and Malaysia airline. Hi, Id like to complain about the experience today with Malaysia Airlines. I was so angry at the flight attendant so here is the complaint I sent to the Malaysia Airlines. I took the airplane from Malaysia to Auckland on July 8th. I have been getting bad service even I was at the airport in Malaysia. People who work here are so rude and they dont know how they talk with customers. I was on the airplane, there was no toilet paper in two bathrooms so I went to the back to use another bathroom. I didnt know where it was so I was looking for it and a flight attendant who named Rasher or something was being rude to me. I asked a man flight attendant what her name is. He was nine at least. So what happened is that when I was looking for the bathroom, she goes the bathroom is here with a disgusted look while she was on the phone even I didnt ask her anything. I was just looking. So I let her know there is no toilet paper in two bathrooms that I went to because she started talking to me even she was on the phone so I said to her nicely. And She said its in the middle. I was like what the hell is she talking about and thats your job to fill it up. Or she doesnt know thats her job lol The manager who said is in charge came to me and asked me what happened and she apologised me but the manager was asking me the flight attendant who was rude to me was on the phone right? Im like okay if she was on the phone, is she allowed to be rude to customers? Does that what she meant? And the rude one started talking to me in the first place not me. She could also say I would not mind to answer it after on the phone or not. Maybe she doesnt have a brain to make a grammar in English so she just said in the middle which I dont know what she meant. And then the rude one came to me to say sorry and she was trying to use she was on the phone as a excuse and she said oh she thought I started talking to her first bra bra bra which is not true. I felt she was trying to find some excuse to make her self look better in the situation. I could see that she doesnt feel sorry she was doing that because there was a manager next to her so I said I dont need apology from you because you already made me comfortable and its too late to apologise. When I said to her you were just doing this because your manager was next to you and she said okay. This kind of person would keep doing the same mistake because her apology doesnt mean anything to her. Ive never had a bad experience like this anywhere on airplanes. Malaysia Airline is horrible. Isnt that Malaysia Airlines that lost the airplane and people who were on the airplane are not found? That explains why you guys treat customers like that and do horrible customer service! Wish I didnt use Malaysia airline so I didnt have to come here to transfer. I would never come to Malaysia again anyway!","The customer service horrible .

"Flight at 705am, we were ask to cross the checkpoint into immigration by 605am. We were 5 mins late, denied enterence, got ping pong around different department for 30mins. Ultimately it was the information counter that seems to know what to do, got into contact with the airline, but it was too late because of the time wasted by the ground crew that doesn't seems to know where to direct us. Airline ground crew are locals, seemed oblivious and gave us the not my problem attitude. Later we went to the airline office to check on how to retrieve our baggage, the staff's attitude was so poor with all the lecturing when we had been running around for 45mins and are in distress. Yes it was our fault for being 5mins late, she could had shown some empathy in her choice if words even though there's nothing she could had done. That's the reality of Malaysian hospitality. 1st class on the surface, 3rd world attitude and mentality.

"Compared to this airport, Incheon Airport is heaven. Kuala Lumpur Airport is a real pain in the ass for both departure and arrival. They dont even properly announce the arrival and departure of flights, immigration is slow, and not only is there queueing, but there are also long lines and no one knows which line is right. If you dare ask the staff a question, they just glare at you and ignore you. I feel like a prisoner, not a traveler. Immigration took 2 hours and 30 minutes. When departing, some boarding gates dont have restrooms. If you are assigned to such a gate, you have to go through a security check every time you go to the restroom. Delays of one hour are common, and I guess thats because the flight control treats us passengers like that.","Compared , Incheon Airport heaven . Kuala Lumpur Airport real pain as departure arrival .

"It's the capital airport of a big country It's hot because they turned on the air conditioner. The bathroom is dirty because it's a toilet like a regular restaurant bathroom~ There's only one smoking room before the baggage checkpoint, but there's no signage. On top of that, it's not cleaned and it's very dirty Despite being a large airport with a lot of transfers, there aren't enough chairs to rest and wait, and there are only paid massage chairs! And there's a lot of shopping. Malaysia is a beggar who's become rich~ Of course, the price is expensive, and even that's almost nonexistent after security. Smokers, you must stop by the smoking room before security. If you go all the way to the corner before the P and Q gates, you'll find the smoking room. After security, it's crowded with people waiting~ It's hard to find a chair~ The structure and area are very stuffy, and it's hard to find any amenities. This is the worst experience.

I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products. Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate when leaving from KL to overseas. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority. Airline still tier off the ticket manually. As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go. Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing.

"Drinking water is a major issue at the airport and there are several reviews mentioning this but nothing has changed. You are not allowed to take your water beyond security which is understandable but how can you not have water filling stations or even bottled water for people waiting to board? It's quite disappointing and shocking, and can be a big issue especially for elderly passengers and those with health issues. In a hot and humid climate, access to drinking water is essential. Unfortunately, there are no water refill stations or bottled water available after security. If there is a flight delay, passengers are left waiting for hours without water. I've been to several airports and never had this issue, just look at Singapore airport where there are water refill facilities everywhere.

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. Oh and did I mention that the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration? I had such a hard time to book the Grab and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, because there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!! This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia. I've never thought an airport would affect my will to visit a country but here we are.","This make never want come back Malaysia . Who design place ? !

I begged her saying you are guest services, you have to help us! I had a flight that leaves in 40 mins. She begrudgingly helped me with attitude.

One of the worst airports in the world. The airlines and the airport will not inform if they change boarding gate. They tell you fight delayed and so you wait at the gate.

"Arriving: Immigration for arrivals took too long! The officers works so slowly and the poor internet connection in this area is not helping either. It took us long enough to complete immigration to the point that our bags were no longer in the conveyor belt/shown on screen. Pick up location of ride hailing (Grab) was easy at Level 1. Departure: Check in counters are spread out making it not too crowded/congested. Immigration for departure is quicker and easier. However, there's a security screening for customs departure that was separated with at-gate security check. I would say this is very inefficient as you need to check your bags twice and once you have cleared security you practically cannot go out to the retail area. This also lead to congestion during Gate Open as people would avoid coming to it and come as late as possible. Security at the gate is so slow. In addition, the post-security gate is a nightmare with neither water stations nor proper toilet! There seems to be no signs of priority boarding based on group but rather by seats (not sure if this is an MH or KLIA problem). Retail space is decent with great tax-free goods options and decent restaurant selections. One thing to appreciate: the toilets (in retail & public) areas are clean and equipped with jet showers.","Arriving : Immigration arrival take long !

"I had an extremely frustrating experience with the immigration process at this airport. The service was painfully slow, with long queues that seemed to move at a snails pace despite there being multiple counters. It felt disorganized and inefficient from the moment I arrived. What made it worse was the attitude of some of the immigration officers. Several of them appeared moody and unapproachable, offering no guidance or courtesy. Instead of helping travelersmany of whom were confused or exhaustedthey seemed irritated and dismissive. I understand their job isnt easy, but a basic level of respect and professionalism should still be expected. This kind of experience leaves a very poor impression, especially for international visitors.

"Extremely Poor Accessibility & Lack of Compassion I brought my elderly grandmotherwho requires a wheelchair and has dementiato the airport, and the accessibility experience was appalling. When I approached the front desk to request a wheelchair, I was told to go all the way to the check-in area at the end of the terminal first. How is someone supposed to leave a person with dementia alone while they go fetch a wheelchair? We had no choice but to walk the entire distance, which completely defeats the purpose of offering assistance in the first place. To make matters worse, the check-in counter we needed was right at the end of the row. If my grandmother had truly been immobile, she wouldve had no way to reach that point on her own. Imagine if she were a solo disabled travellerwhat would have happened then? Even more disappointing was the staff attitude. There were six front counter staff chatting among themselves, not a single smile, not a trace of compassion or initiative. It felt like basic empathy and responsibility were missing entirely. Accessibility should not be an afterthought, and neither should kindness.","Extremely Poor Accessibility & Lack Compassion I bring elderly grandmotherwho require wheelchair dementiato , accessibility experience appal .

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling. This looks fancy but very old school. Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating Very confusing direction or procedure. I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products. Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority. As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go. Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there.

"The immigration officers are rude and disrespectful. Not only do they seem uneducated, they are pretty disgusting in their treatment of travellers. Many Malays receive English education from elementary school but still can't speak English properly! How does that work? To be honest, it felt like the staff were completely uninterested in their job, and some even seemed to resent being there. If you don't want to be bullied, shouted at or ignored when asking questions during an already stressful flight trip, then avoid this airport at all cost! I was here on a 3 hour transit trip and within a span of those hours the amount of bullying and incompetence I observed was horrifying. Trust me this airport doesn't discriminate, nearly everyone of all nationalities and ethnicities feel the brunt of their hostility. Also, within 3 hours, the gate changed like 6 times! I have been to many major airports before, never faced something like this. What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: We hope youve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality. Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered. Given this experience, I will never visit Malaysia again and I certainly won't be encouraging my friends or family to visit. Avoid countries that do not respect and appreciate tourist coming to help their economy!","The immigration officer rude disrespectful . Not seem uneducated , pretty disgust treatment traveller .

Will avoid this airport as much as possible in the future.","Good , reasonably clean well maintain design security gate make thing difficult gate change occur last moment .

"For such a major international hub, the airport felt a little confusing and chaotic. We ran into the same issue two times - once on arrival (for transit) and once for departure. During arrival we wanted to switch from C Gates to A/B gates for domestic departure but it was confusing to find the directions. Exactly at the same location, during departure, we had to switch to C gates but got confused. We later realised that one of the sign boards is actually wrong. It points to an escalator upwards that goes into the shopping area. Whereas the C gates entry is exactly in the opposite direction of the sign. For an international airport this is not acceptable at all. I dont have photos, but getting confused at the same place two times is not right. We saw a few others get confused too. Apart from that there is no major security check and body scan before immigration. However this is done prior to boarding. This is not as per standard processes elsewhere wherein the detailed security check and body scan is done immediately at entry. Somehow disappointed with the airport.","For major international hub , felt little confusing chaotic . We run issue two time - arrival ( transit ) departure .

"Ive traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always stood out for its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, is a beautiful highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of foreign and unique local offerings. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its due- the new bathrooms are a massive improvement! Well-designed, clean, and dry. But I cant ignore the disappointing shift in retail and dining options. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. Also why is alcohol and tobacco taking up a large portion of the retail space every time? I was shocked to find only one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a foodie havenwhy isnt KLIA showcasing its rich culinary heritage and diversity? This seem to now be engulfed by the blandness of foreign cafe franchises, croissants and cakes. Would be delightful to have more local options! Gone are the great local options that once served authentic dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles and teh tarik. Instead, global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans dominate the F&B spaces. Surely, theres room for more homegrown eateries that represent Malaysias incredible food culture? To add to the frustration, the monorail is still not working, and travelers have to rely on shuttle buses- slow and less efficient. And when I asked an Ask Me For Help staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phonecustomer service should be better than this. KLIA, we can do better! Support local businesses and bring back the true Malaysian experience.","Ive travel KLIA countless time year , always stand cleanliness , smooth check-in process , efficient security check .

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight. Although the airport was large and packed with lots of shops and eateries, there are areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving/departure passengers. Personally, I wasnt expecting to go through the hassle of having to transit from the plane to the arrival hall, taking into consideration that this was a direct flight. Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member, who was shouting, to proceed to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall. This information could easily be missed if people are talking or focused on finding the nearest toilet. I tried to console myself, thinking that perhaps our flight was scheduled to park in a further lot due to multiple flights arriving around the same time. Anyway, just go with the flow and follow those in front since we are told to .... Would suggest the following improvements: * Rather than having a staff member shout instructions, you can consider placing clear, large signage on both sides of the walkway as passengers disembark. * Provide more readily available information upon flight arrival / departure. * Consider adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Clear directional signs and information would make a big difference for first-time visitors like myself and would save a lot of time especially when you have so many incoming/outgoing flights day to day..... The signage for the bus transfer was unclear, and it took approximately 4-5 minutes to find the waiting point to queue for the feeder bus to the arrival hall. Upon arriving at the arrival hall, it was another 2-minute walk to reach immigration. The area was extremely crowded, with queues of 2-3 lines in a row, resulting in an hour-long wait to clear immigration. The process was very disorganized and messy, with no one managing the human traffic, possibly due to a shortage of manpower. Although the officers were friendly and efficient in clearing the queue, it would be beneficial to have crowd control/security to guide and manage the flow of passengers. Locating the correct baggage belt after clearing immigration was another challenge. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts, requiring passengers to walk near the belt to check the monitor screen. This was frustrating, especially with different groups of people surrounding the area, some looking for directions, some waiting for friends, and others searching for the right belt. We eventually found our luggage placed not far away from the luggage belt area near the exit, with a sign displaying the SQ Airlines logo on the floor. Many unclaimed bags from our flight were present, as most passengers were still stuck in immigration. The entire process, from disembarking the plane to retrieving our luggage outside the baggage claim area, was challenging. I thought we were only required to transit to the arrival hall as a one-time occurrence. However, on our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall. Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient. As a tourist, the airport gives the first impression for passengers, and its organization is crucial. I hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements","I write provide feedback recent experience fly KLIA via Singapore Airlines .

"Ive traveled through KLIA countless times, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its duethe new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well-designed, clean, and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail spacewhy so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradisewhy isnt KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign caf chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti? Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysias rich culinary diversity?- take a page out of Jakarta or Singapore airport. To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (Ive lost count how long Ive waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an Ask Me For Help staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone. Customer service should be better than this! KLIA, lets do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers. P.S. if youre ever at the Satellite building of KLIA terminal 1, I highly recommend checking out the Jungle Boardwalk I always look forward to visiting it if my Gate is located there.","Ive travel KLIA countless time , always impress cleanliness , smooth check-in process , efficient security check .

It was also very crowded when we went inside to eat. I thought fast food would be faster, but the line at Burger King, ordering and picking up, can take an hour. It's not even fast food!? In the end, we didn't have time to eat and had to take it to go. There wasn't a single store in the airport that we could explore. The inspection process here is also very unique. You can bring water through the first checkpoint, but you have to go through the X-ray machine again before boarding the plane. You can't bring water this time. You're directly on the plane.

"KLIA Main Terminal is definitely looking tired now. Arrivals process is laborious, through a dark Immigration area (with a long queue almost always) into a dingy baggage claim area. Then prepare to run the gauntlet of taxi hawkers. Toilets are filthy. Car rental area is in an even dirtier forgotten part of a car park, well away from the terminal. Horrendous and frightening journey for single females to negotiate to. At least LCCT has Car rental booths actually in the terminal at arrivals. Update January 2023 and nothing has improved about KLIA 1. The car rental office area is nothing short of a discusting, hot & humid, car fume filled enclosed area. Staffed by people who need to be motivated away from their phones to serve you. That just completes the whole slow, painful experience of a dark and miserable KLIA and a sorry welcome to Malaysia. A national disgrace that needs to be addressed from the miserable gate staff, immigration & customs officials, to the customer facing staff throughout. Unfortunately people like myself have no choice but to suffer KLIA regularly.","KLIA Main Terminal definitely look tire .

"Spacious airport with lots of shops but it is unacceptable and dangerous not to have the possibility of buying a bottle of water after going through security or access to a drinking fountain or toilet while waiting for the plane. You have to leave the platform to drink/go to the toilet, go through security again before returning. In addition, Etihad only provides a few mini glasses of water during its 7-hour flight, and there is no possibility of buying a bottle on the plane either. We were on a flight without air conditioning and without a bottle of water with the plane on the ground for 2 hours due to a technical problem followed by 7 hours of flight with only a few glasses of water to keep going.

"Ive traveled through KLIA countless times, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading. With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where its due- the new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well designed, good ventilation, clean and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail spacewhy so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradisewhy isnt KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign coffe chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti? Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysias rich culinary diversity?- take a page out of Jakarta or Singapore airport. To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (Ive lost count how long Ive waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an Ask Me For Help staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone as she was too busy texting her friend to care. Customer service should be better than this! KLIA, lets do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers. P.S. if youre ever at the Satellite building of KLIA terminal 1 (after the shuttle service), I highly recommend visiting the Jungle Boardwalk - a small beautiful green forest in the middle of the building I always look forward to visiting it if my Gate is located there.","Ive travel KLIA countless time , always impress cleanliness , smooth check-in process , efficient security check .

"No vegetarian options in most places and no where served non-dairy milk options. This seems quite outdated to me considering how many people dont eat meat or drink dairy. I am lactose intolerant.

We then proceeded to enter our gate to be told we werent allowed water or food through.

"There are many things to improve at this airport. There are twice as many security checks, passport checks, and boarding passes as at a Western airport. Just to give an example, the security process (where they check your water and all that) is right in front of the boarding gate. This means that once you've passed through security, you can't buy anything, including the toilet, water, etc. Aside from the inconvenience for travelers, it means underutilization of the machines for the airport, because they're only used when there's a flight at that gate, and fewer sales opportunities, because you're confined to that room for at least an hour and a half before the flight departs, waiting to actually board. They have a lot to learn from their neighbors in Singapore, a little further south.","There many thing improve . There twice many security check , passport check , board pass Western .

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?! First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. Ive traveled through many large airports, but Ive never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that but what came next was even worse. After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub. We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (were used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle. Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we werent allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, ""because it's too late now to buy tickets"" (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel. In the end, we paid almost triple the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there. Oh and did I mention that the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration? I had such a hard time to book the Grab and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, because there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!!

"I'm giving it 1 star for the following reasons: T1-> the security check only takes place immediately before boarding. This means that if you buy drinks before then (which you take with you on long-haul flights), you have to return them! Which is completely pointless! Furthermore, there's nothing to eat after baggage drop-off and passport control (which you want to get through as quickly as possible). Furthermore, there are no restrooms after the security check, so you'll wait about an hour for boarding plus a good 45 minutes until you're in the air to use a restroom...

"Unarguably the most flaws design airport. Even India's small airport like Rajahmundry have better flow than this airport. The don't have toilet inside the boarding gate. We have to back and forth to go to toilet and scan boarding pass. I already told the imbecile staff that it's no need to do that. He tried to scanned it again and the light go red (stated already board). Even though he already do something wrong, he did the same mistake to my son behind me. What a waste a time and energy.

"Edit: upon arrival as of June 2025, they removed auto entry now for foreign passports and only locals can go through them- what a waste of automated gates! KLIA is a massive airport, but as of December 2024, its still undergoing some upgrading works, so not everything is fully operational (has been going on for the past year). Shops and dining options are still quite limited despite the airport's large size, which is a bit disappointing for travelers looking to explore or relax before their flights. On the positive side, for certain passport holders, the biometric scanning at immigration makes the process quick and efficient, which is a welcome convenience. However, the baggage scanning process remains tediousyoure required to scan your bags multiple times, such as when entering immigration and again when heading to your gate. Personally, this feels unnecessarily repetitive, but theres little travelers can do about it. Overall, KLIA has potential, and hopefully, the ongoing upgrades will bring noticeable improvements to both the facilities and passenger experience in the near future.","Edit : upon arrival June 2025 , remove auto entry foreign passport local go them- waste automated gate !

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Malaysia is a major aviation hub known for its modern infrastructure and significant passenger capacity. It features two main terminals: KLIA1 (Main Terminal) for full-service airlines and KLIA2, which is the worlds largest terminal dedicated to low-cost carriers. Both terminals provide extensive amenities such as check-in counters, retail outlets, duty-free shops, lounges, and a range of dining options. Despite its impressive size and facilities, passenger experiences at KLIA show a mixed picture. Some travelers appreciate the airports efficiency, particularly with business class services that offer quick access to lounges and smooth security checks. The connectivity is good, with efficient transportation options like the KLIA Ekspres train linking the airport to Kuala Lumpur city center in under 30 minutes, plus taxis and buses are readily available. However, there are notable complaints that affect the overall impression. Passengers frequently cite poor staff behavior, long queues, and confusion during boarding and baggage checks, often describing staff as unfriendly or inattentive. Some criticize the immigration process, mentioning inconvenient requirements and poor assistance, especially for transit passengers. Food and beverage options, particularly in KLIA2, have received negative reviews for being limited, expensive, or insufficient for the passenger volume. Seating areas can be inadequate during peak times, and the indoor climate control sometimes falls short, making waiting uncomfortable. In terms of infrastructure, KLIA offers modern and clean facilities, with well-organized terminals and a spacious layout. The addition of automated train systems within KLIA1 and a skybridge in KLIA2 has improved passenger movement. The airport continues to be recognized for service quality by industry bodies, but in practice, staff performance and customer service remain areas needing improvement. Overall, KLIA is a modern and strategically important airport that provides extensive amenities and connectivity but is let down by inconsistent service quality and operational challenges that impact traveler satisfaction.Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Malaysia is a major and modern airport serving millions yearly, with two main terminals: KLIA1 for full-service airlines and KLIA2 dedicated to budget carriers. Both terminals feature extensive amenities including retail outlets, duty-free shops, lounges, and various dining options, supported by advanced infrastructure like automated trains and skybridges for smooth passenger transfers. While the airport excels in its size, facilities, and connectivityoffering quick transportation options like the KLIA Ekspres train to Kuala Lumpurit has garnered mixed overall reviews from travelers. Many praise KLIA1 for efficient and smooth security and boarding processes, especially for business class passengers. However, there are widespread complaints about staff attitude, with reports of unfriendly and inattentive personnel, chaotic queues, and confusing procedures that dampen the experience. Other common issues include limited food and beverage options, especially in KLIA2, overcrowded seating areas, and inconsistent indoor climate control, making waiting uncomfortable during peak times. Some travelers also find the immigration and transfer processes cumbersome, with poor assistance and odd paperwork requirements for transit passengers. Despite these challenges, KLIA maintains a clean and modern terminal environment with generally well-maintained facilities. It has received industry awards for its infrastructure and immigration service, but passenger experiences suggest that improving customer service and operational management is needed to match the airports world-class status. In summary, KLIA offers comprehensive facilities and good connectivity as Malaysias primary international gateway but is hampered by service inconsistencies and operational issues that impact passenger satisfaction.","Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) Malaysia major aviation hub know modern infrastructure significant passenger capacity .

"I used Terminal 2 (KLIA2), which is mainly used by low-cost carriers. There are many restaurants just outside the arrival gate, and many of them are open 24 hours a day, which is very convenient. There are many seats where you can charge your phones, and some stores have Wi-Fi. The food court a little further back to the left of the arrival gate has very cheap prices. The supermarket called JayaGROCER is also cheap. When you arrive, you can get to the city center by taking the KLIA Express, a limited express train, which is cheap and fast. However, there are restrictions on departure times, so if you want to get around easily, you should use the car dispatch service ""Grab"" or a taxi. The cheapest option is by far the bus. There is a luxurious lounge that accepts Priority Pass (3-hour system) at the back of LEVEL3, where the boarding gate is located, to the left. I saw a few people sleeping on the ground on the boarding gate floor at night. However, the downside is that it is a very long walk to the boarding gate. After the initial simple baggage inspection, it takes about 20 minutes to walk to the gate.","I use Terminal 2 ( KLIA2 ) , mainly use low-cost carrier .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport, also known as KLIA. In addition to the main airport building, there's a separate, cross-shaped airport building for arrivals and boarding.

"Very nice airport with a great viewing area. Plenty of food places and the souvenir shops sold items at good prices. They were of course higher than at shops, but for an airport, they were good. The baggage drop for British airways took a very long time. If flying with Malaysian airways and some other Asian airlines, there was practically no queue as it was self service. Then there was immigration, which opened up to more shops. After immigration, the bags were kind of scanned, but this wasn't security. This then opens up to more shops and restaurants. Only 1 out of the 4 water fountains worked at this point and the water was only for consumption in this area, because you then pass through security when the gate opens. After security, there are just seats. No water and no toilets. I found there to be a lot of walking around to the next point, but there many shops making it a good experience","Very nice great viewing area . Plenty food place souvenir shop sell item good price .

"Had an amazing experience at this massive terminal. Unfortunately, we didn't get to spend much time at the airport. And the arrivals process was a bit confusing, considering it was our first time at such a massive airport. KUL acts as the main hub into Malaysia, and especially Kuala Lumpur. The smaller Subang airport is mostly used for regional or domestic flights. KILA airport express serves as a great alternative to grabbing a taxi or a bus to and from the airport, as it terminated at KL Sentral. Some airlines like air Asia provide luggage check-in at KL Sentral, making it more convinent.","Had amazing experience massive terminal . Unfortunately , n't get spend much time .

"The airport is very large. Arrivals on a Tuesday evening were relatively smooth. Famous restaurants like Hua Yang and Hai Jiao Ren are located at the airport. I highly recommend checking them out first, as the lines at restaurants downtown are incredibly long. Departures on Saturday morning were a bit more chaotic, with incredibly crowded people and numerous check-in counters. They weren't divided by flight. From previous travel experience, children can't check in at the check-in counter. So, initially, we kept looking for a human check-in counter. We asked three staff members, each with a different explanation. This wasted a lot of time. It just so happened that our flight was delayed by an hour, otherwise we might have missed it. The restaurant in the airport lobby was incredibly crowded. After finally getting a table, it took another 30 minutes. We later discovered there were still many shops and restaurants after customs. Furthermore, baggage screening at customs required two checks, and the distance from customs to the boarding gate was quite long. On the way back, I recommend exploring and eating at the gate. You don't have to crowd the outermost area; the restaurants inside are just like the airport lobby. Best of all, they were less crowded, allowing you to leisurely wait for your flight. We had some fast food recommended by a local. The cola looked like root beer, served from a machine that looked like draft beer. It was quite interesting. The pancakes were surprisingly deliciouslarge, crispy, and generously prepared.","The large . Arrivals Tuesday evening relatively smooth . Famous restaurant like Hua Yang Hai Jiao Ren locate .

"Edit: upon arrival as of June 2025, they removed auto entry now for foreign passports and only locals can go through them- what a waste of automated gates! KLIA is a massive airport, but as of December 2024, its still undergoing some upgrading works, so not everything is fully operational (has been going on for the past year). Shops and dining options are still quite limited despite the airport's large size, which is a bit disappointing for travelers looking to explore or relax before their flights. On the positive side, for certain passport holders, the biometric scanning at immigration makes the process quick and efficient, which is a welcome convenience. However, the baggage scanning process remains tediousyoure required to scan your bags multiple times, such as when entering immigration and again when heading to your gate. Personally, this feels unnecessarily repetitive, but theres little travelers can do about it. Overall, KLIA has potential, and hopefully, the ongoing upgrades will bring noticeable improvements to both the facilities and passenger experience in the near future.","Edit : upon arrival June 2025 , remove auto entry foreign passport local go them- waste automated gate !

The terminals are split between buildings but at least the transfer buses are always available and the distance is short. There is ample lighting in the terminals and the areas that are dim are perfect for sleeping in. Gates are clearly signposted and the amount of walking is not too challenging. Not a lot to do here as shop selections are really minimal. Interestingly, KL was the place to shop back in the 1980s.

"So first of all: the airport is big!!! The usual recommendation to be at the airport at least 3 hours before departure should be strictly adhered to. There are multiple floors and the terminal with Gates C is outside and requires an additional bus ride. Positive: There is a large selection of warm food and drinks in the Arrival Hall early in the morning. The Departure Hall is on the top floor and is very cluttered and full of people. It's important to stay calm and ask for the airline at the information counter. The signage at the counters is small and you would have to look through all of them until you find the right one. (If you fly with Etihad Airways... it's counter A.) It's best to check in online... it saves time. There were initially only a few counters open and some passengers had a lot of suitcases that were all weighed and labeled. The same thing happens with hand luggage.

"KLIA 1 Airport is quite big and beautiful, but the design is a bit old-fashioned. I got Gate C for International Departures and had to take another bus to get there because this airport is so big. Luckily the road signs are quite clear, and the bus also comes quickly. It's just a bit risky if you want to arrive close to the departure schedule. The rules at this airport are quite strict, especially in carrying liquids which must be less than 100 ml, when it comes to baggage, I observed that it was safe, there were no significant problems.","KLIA 1 Airport quite big beautiful , design bit old-fashioned .

"KLIA has room for improvement in several areas. The air conditioning was not cold enough, making the airport feel quite stuffy. The water dispensers were not functioning, which was inconvenient for travelers looking to refill their bottles. Signage is another major issue, particularly for McDonald's. While there's a visible kiosk near Jamie Oliver, the other McDonald's outlet is poorly marked and easy to miss, hidden behind people and lacking clear directions. The KFC location is also not well-indicated, making it difficult for first-time visitors to find. On a positive note, the toilet cleanliness is commendable. The cleaning staff are diligent, ensuring the facilities are spotless after each use. This level of hygiene is definitely appreciated and sets a good standard for airport maintenance.","KLIA room improvement several area . The air conditioning cold enough , make feel quite stuffy .

"Disappointed with KLIA1s Renovation Wheres the Local Flavor? Ive traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, easy check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, influenced by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, is a highlight. But what made KLIA truly special was the presence of local food, beverages, and products. With the recent renovation of KLIA1, I have to say I am very pleased with the new improved bathrooms- better designed, clean and dry :) But Ive noticed a disappointing shiftmany local offerings have been replaced by foreign goods, with alcohol and tobacco dominating the retail space. I was shocked to find only one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal! Malaysia is a foodie paradise with so much to offer- why isnt KLIA showcasing it? Previously, there were great local cafs serving authentic Malaysian dishes like prawn noodles and teh tarik. Now, all I see are global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jeans. Cant there be more homegrown F&B options for travelers to experience real Malaysian flavors? To top it off, the monorail is still not working (shuttle busses are the alternate) and my attempt to ask an Ask Me For Help staff member about food options was met with disinterestshe was too busy scrolling on her phone to assist me properly.

"Airport Terminal 1 boasts modern upgrades to its luggage drop, check-in, immigration processes, and overall size. It's located approximately 60 minutes from Kuala Lumpur by car, or a quicker 45-minute journey via express train. However, there are a few areas for potential improvement. 1. Currently, there is a lack of a dedicated food court.

Seating is somewhat limited. 3. Entertainment options for children and families could be expanded. 4. The washrooms could be enhanced by providing tissue paper in the hand-wash areas. 5.

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport is generally fine, clean, and organized. My experience with the immigration officer was also nice, they were polite and professional. However, the immigration line was extremely long. We ended up waiting around 2 hours just to get through. It would be much better if they had autogates available for all international visitors, not just for selected countries. That would save so much time and make the arrival process smoother. Overall, the airport itself is good, but the long wait at immigration was really exhausting.","Kuala Lumpur International Airport generally fine , clean , organize .

"Edit: upon arrival, they removed auto entry now for foreign passports and only locals can go through them- what a waste of automated gates! KLIA is a massive airport, but as of December 2024, its still undergoing some upgrading works, so not everything is fully operational (has been going on for the past year). Shops and dining options are still quite limited despite the airport's large size, which is a bit disappointing for travelers looking to explore or relax before their flights. On the positive side, for certain passport holders, the biometric scanning at immigration makes the process quick and efficient, which is a welcome convenience. However, the baggage scanning process remains tediousyoure required to scan your bags multiple times, such as when entering immigration and again when heading to your gate. Personally, this feels unnecessarily repetitive, but theres little travelers can do about it. Overall, KLIA has potential, and hopefully, the ongoing upgrades will bring noticeable improvements to both the facilities and passenger experience in the near future.","Edit : upon arrival , remove auto entry foreign passport local go them- waste automated gate !

"""1.10.2025"" Kuala Lumpur International Airport was newer than I'd expected. It's spacious and transparent, surrounded by greenery, and its atmosphere is similar to Singapore's Changi Airport. After landing, I had to take the MRT to get to the baggage area. Although there were a lot of people, everything was very orderly. Taiwanese passport holders can go directly through the automated customs clearance system, which is very convenient.","`` 1.10.2025 '' Kuala Lumpur International Airport new I 'd expect .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is more than just a travel hub its a complete experience that blends efficiency, comfort, and a touch of Malaysian hospitality. From the moment you arrive, the design of the airport stands out. The main terminal building is bright, spacious, and airy, with a modern architectural style that still feels warm and welcoming. The satellite building, connected by the Aerotrain, adds to the sense of scale and convenience, making it easy for passengers to transfer between terminals. In terms of navigation, KLIA is well signposted, with clear directions in English and Malay. Even for first-time visitors, its relatively simple to find immigration, baggage claim, and onward connections. While the airport is large, the layout is intuitive, and staff members are friendly and ready to assist if you ever feel lost. Immigration and security checks are usually smooth and efficient, although during peak travel hours there can be queues nothing unusual for an airport of this size. The facilities here are excellent. There is a wide variety of food and drink options catering to every budget, from local Malaysian dishes (which I highly recommend if you have time) to international fast food, coffee shops, and sit-down restaurants. Shopping is also a highlight the duty-free selection is extensive, with everything from cosmetics and electronics to Malaysian souvenirs and delicacies. If youre in transit or have a long layover, KLIA makes the wait comfortable. There are plenty of lounges, seating areas, and even a capsule hotel where you can book a few hours of rest. The airport also has prayer rooms, child-friendly facilities, and smoking zones, which shows that it caters thoughtfully to different types of travelers. Free Wi-Fi is available, though it can sometimes be a little slow, so its good to have mobile data as backup. Getting to and from the airport is extremely convenient. The KLIA Ekspres train is one of the best features it takes just under 30 minutes to reach KL Sentral in the city center, and its fast, comfortable, and reliable. Taxis and ride-hailing services are also widely available, and buses provide budget-friendly options. One thing to keep in mind is that the airport is quite large, so be prepared to walk a fair bit between gates or from security to boarding. For some travelers, this can be tiring, but the clear signage and moving walkways help a lot. Overall, KLIA is a world-class airport that balances efficiency with comfort. Its clean, modern, and well-maintained, but it also has a distinct cultural touch that reminds you youre in Malaysia. Whether youre arriving, departing, or transiting, KLIA leaves a positive impression and sets the tone for a great journey.","Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) travel hub complete experience blend efficiency , comfort , touch Malaysian hospitality .

They quickly assisted me in locating my tablet and went above and beyondone of them personally delivered it to me from the other building.

"(Visiting before 2024) This time, I flew Air Asia, a Malaysian budget airline, to Kuala Lumpur International Airport for connecting flights to other countries. Kuala Lumpur International Airport has several terminals. Kuala Lumpur is a very large international airport, and if you have a layover or a long layover, you can take a shuttle bus to different terminals. The main hall is quite large, but if you're traveling between terminals, you need to plan your transfer time and board your flight accordingly.","( Visiting 2024 ) This time , I fly Air Asia , Malaysian budget airline , Kuala Lumpur International Airport connect flight country .

"A seamless experience at KLIA, one of the best airports in Southeast Asia Traveling through Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is always comfortable and efficient. From the moment you arrive, you're greeted by a modern, clean, and well-organized facility, where it's clear that passenger comfort and overall smooth operation are a priority. Passport control is very streamlined, especially if you're eligible to use the automated e-gates (it's worth checking if your passport is listed). The entire process is quick and hassle-free, which is a great start to any international trip. Once you clear immigration, the airport is spacious and very well-maintained. The gates for Area C are easily reached via a regular shuttle train that departs after passport control. Everything is well signposted and easy to navigate. There are tons of options for both shopping and dining, so you'll never feel bored while you wait. From duty-free shops to local and international restaurants, there's plenty to discover before boarding. A helpful tip: KLIA is approximately 45 minutes from downtown Kuala Lumpur (KLCC) if you travel early in the morning when there's no traffic. During the day, it's a good idea to allow between one and one hour and ten minutes, depending on congestion. We traveled from Terminal 1, which serves many major international airlines such as Etihad (A), Emirates (B), Turkish Airlines (M), and several others. It's advisable to check your gate assignment in advance, as it can change shortly before departure! We had the opportunity to try Illy coffee near Gate C13. Although there was quite a line, service was quick once the order was placed. The staff was friendly and helpful. However, the coffee left something to be desired. The Americano and cappuccino had a strange taste, somewhat resembling burnt marshmallows. Still, the sourdough bakery selection was quite good, with fresh and satisfying options for pre-flight snacks. Overall, KLIA is an excellent international hub. Clean, efficient, and well-thought-out. If they improve the coffee quality a bit in some areas, it would be near perfect. Still, I would definitely transit or depart from KLIA again. Highly recommended for both frequent travelers and first-time flyers. Smooth Experience at KLIA - One of Southeast Asia's Best Airports! Traveling through Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is always a comfortable and efficient experience. From the moment you arrive, you're met with a clean, modern, and well-organized facility that clearly prioritizes both passenger comfort and operational efficiency. Passport control is a breeze, especially if you're eligible to use the automated e-gates (check if your passport is listed beforehand). The process is quick and fuss-free... a great start to any international journey Once you pass immigration, you'll find the airport impressively spacious and well-maintained. The departure gates at Concourse C are accessible by a smooth and regular train shuttle after passport control; very simple with clear signage throughout Retail and dining options are abundant, so you'll never feel bored during your wait. From duty-free shops to local and international eateries, there's plenty to explore while waiting for your flight. A small note on timing KLIA is located around 45 minutes from KLCC (city centre) early in the morning when traffic is light. However, during daytime hours, I recommend allowing at least 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes for the journey, depending on traffic conditions!!! We flew out of Terminal 1, which handles many major international carriers including Etihad (A), Emirates (B), Turkish Airlines (M) and several others. Its worth double-checking your gate assignment as signage can sometimes be updated close to departure...","A seamless experience KLIA , one best airport Southeast Asia Traveling Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) always comfortable efficient .

"I often use this airport when traveling to Southeast Asia or South Asia. If I remember correctly, it was designed by Kurokawa Kisho. Terminal 1 is home to many Malaysia Airlines flights. Terminal 2 has a larger number of LCCs. It's a fairly large airport, and Terminals 1 and 2 are quite far apart. You can take the shuttle bus or the high-speed train. It takes a while. Terminal 1 also has a satellite terminal, and there is an unmanned train between the main terminal and the satellite terminal. This takes just a moment. Terminal 1 also has a full range of duty-free shops and a wide selection of restaurants. At airport prices, though. I was happy to see an airport piano. The airport staff were all friendly and welcoming. The exhibits inside the airport were also elaborate. When I visited, they were themed around Malacca. The center is set up like a garden. There are plenty of chairs, including some comfortable ones where you might want to take a nap.","I often use travel Southeast Asia South Asia . If I remember correctly , design Kurokawa Kisho .

"June 24, 2025, Day 1 On the first day of my Southeast Asian adventure, I flew to Kuala Lumpur Airport. Perhaps because of the new terminal, the overall decor was fresh. During immigration, you could buy things and be greeted with tea, something not found at other airports. Following the instructions, I boarded the shuttle bus and entered smoothly. If you're taking the express train, you can also follow the instructions. There's a significant difference in travel time between the express and regular trains, so I recommend taking the express line directly for a less crowded and more comfortable experience.","June 24 , 2025 , Day 1 On first day Southeast Asian adventure , I fly Kuala Lumpur Airport .

Here's a breakdown of the experience: Highlights: Modern Infrastructure KLIA is clean, spacious, and well-designed. The terminalsKLIA (Main Terminal) and KLIA2 (Low-cost Terminal)are efficiently connected via train and shuttle. Connectivity Excellent connectivity via ERL (Express Rail Link) to central Kuala Lumpur in just ~30 minutes. Clear signage in English and Malay makes navigation easy for international travelers. Immigration & Security Immigration can be quick during non-peak hours, but delays are possible during busy times. Security is generally smooth and well-organized. Shopping & Amenities KLIA offers duty-free shops, premium brands, local crafts, and great food courts. Muslim prayer rooms, child play areas, lounges, and clean restrooms add to the comfort. Hospitality & Help Desks Friendly and professional staff. Help counters and digital info kiosks are helpful, especially for first-time visitors. Things to Keep in Mind: KLIA2 is separate and caters mostly to AirAsia and budget carriersplan accordingly if you have a connecting flight between KLIA and KLIA2. Transit times between gates can be long; allow extra time, especially for international connections. Consultants Tip: Use the Plaza Premium Lounge for long layoversits affordable and well-equipped.

"One of beautiful and big airports I have visited. The only challenge is that it is a bit far from the city so one needs to plan accordingly. One small tip, if you are travelling more than two, its better to go to the city using the grab cab rather than the KLIA express. There is a lot of shopping options in the city, I could not find much shops in my terminal. But still there are enough to shop in case you are looking forward to shop some duty free items. Overall a good experience. Happy travelling!!!!","One beautiful big airport I visit . The challenge bit far city one need plan accordingly .

"The airport is clean, well-maintained, and aesthetically pleasing. The staff is friendly and helpful, making my first visit to Malaysia welcoming despite initial nervousness. I was ball of nerves but immigration officer was patient with me. However, my return experience was marred by an immigration officer, ""Aya"" (if I recall correctly), who was rude and loud. This was disappointing and impacted my overall experience. Politeness costs nothing but can significantly influence someone's perception of a country. While this incident was hurtful, it contrasted with the warm and professional interactions I had with other staff and locals during my visit, which were overwhelmingly positive. I will surely visit the country again.","The clean , well-maintained , aesthetically please . The staff friendly helpful , make first visit Malaysia welcome despite initial nervousness .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is undoubtedly one of the most modern and efficient hubs in Southeast Asia. The facilities are spacious, clean, and well-signposted, making travel easy, even for those unfamiliar with the area. Connections to the city center via the KLIA Express train are fast and convenient, allowing passengers to reach the capital in just 30 minutes. The dining scene is also varied, with local and international options available in both the arrivals and departures areas. The security and customer service staff are generally friendly and helpful, and immigration controls are usually relatively smooth if you don't arrive during rush hour. However, one of KLIA's major weaknesses is the limited number of rest areas for passengers in transit or with long layovers. Although there are some VIP lounges and capsule hotels with a fee, the airport doesn't offer enough comfortable public areas for reclining or sleeping, something that is sorely lacking when it comes to overnight waits or long connections. Improvements in this area would make the overall experience much more pleasant. In short, an efficient and modern airport, but one that needs to consider the comfort of travelers in transit more.","Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) undoubtedly one modern efficient hub Southeast Asia .

"Nothing to complain about to be honest. Its huge, its convenient, youll find a restroom in like every 20 steps. The whole space smelled of citronella which I didnt know why either, but maybe they just like the smell since the plane smelled the same (will be a bit dizzying if youre not an Asian and isnt used to this strong scent). The transit area was relatively small compared to other airports so the staff only let you in when its like only minutes until the flight, which was understandable so I dont blame them - you can always settle for a drink or snack at a nearby stall.

"Modern, well-connected, and spacious international airport Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is one of Southeast Asias most impressive airports. Its clean, well-organized, and offers plenty of services for both international and domestic travelers. The airport is split into two terminals: KLIA (main terminal) for full-service airlines and KLIA2 for budget carriers like AirAsia. A free shuttle bus runs between them frequently, which is super convenient. The main terminal (KLIA) is spacious with high ceilings and even includes a small indoor rainforesta really unique touch! Immigration and customs can be slow during peak hours, but the staff are generally friendly and helpful. Signage throughout the airport is clear, and its easy to find your way around. KLIA2 is more modern in terms of retail options, offering a wide variety of shops, restaurants, and lounges. It has more of a shopping mall feel and is perfect if you have a long layover. However, walking distances can be long, so plan accordingly. The KLIA Ekspres train makes travel to and from downtown Kuala Lumpur quick and easy (about 30 minutes), which is a major plus. Some downsides include occasional delays at immigration and certain gates that require shuttle buses, which isnt ideal for tired travelers. Still, overall, KLIA is a great airportefficient, comfortable, and a solid first impression of Malaysia.","Modern , well-connected , spacious international Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) one Southeast Asias impressive airport .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) A Major Asian Hub with Smooth Connectivity | Travel Consultant Review As a travel consultant, I often recommend KLIA as a transit point or entry to Southeast Asia. Here's a breakdown of the experience: Highlights: Modern Infrastructure KLIA is clean, spacious, and well-designed. The terminalsKLIA (Main Terminal) and KLIA2 (Low-cost Terminal)are efficiently connected via train and shuttle. Connectivity Excellent connectivity via ERL (Express Rail Link) to central Kuala Lumpur in just ~30 minutes. Clear signage in English and Malay makes navigation easy for international travelers. Immigration & Security Immigration can be quick during non-peak hours, but delays are possible during busy times. Security is generally smooth and well-organized. Shopping & Amenities KLIA offers duty-free shops, premium brands, local crafts, and great food courts. Muslim prayer rooms, child play areas, lounges, and clean restrooms add to the comfort. Hospitality & Help Desks Friendly and professional staff. Help counters and digital info kiosks are helpful, especially for first-time visitors. Things to Keep in Mind: KLIA2 is separate and caters mostly to AirAsia and budget carriersplan accordingly if you have a connecting flight between KLIA and KLIA2. Transit times between gates can be long; allow extra time, especially for international connections. Consultants Tip: Use the Plaza Premium Lounge for long layoversits affordable and well-equipped. Download the Malaysia Airports app for real-time updates and gate information.

"There were some good and not so good things about travelling through KL International Airport. Hospitality from all staff I interacted with was good. It was helpful, friendly, and courteous. The airport was also very clean and had a lot of facilities. It is very spacious, which was both positive and negative. It meant that there was plenty of space to sit and relax before the flight and quiet places could be found. On the minus side, it meant a lot of walking to get from place to place, and at times, I found it to be a bit chaotic and disorganised, finding our way around. It was a bit of a longer walk for us to get to the gate. Once there, we hopped on a bus that drove us across the terminal grounds. This took a while, too. Once off the bus, it was another longer walk to the actual gate.","There good good thing travel KL International Airport . Hospitality staff I interact good . It helpful , friendly , courteous .

"1. The structure is unique. 2. Arrival and departure meet at the duty-free shop. 3. This means security screening is done at the gate. 4. The duty-free shop sells a variety of items, but there's no real price advantage. 5. There are numerous cafes and light meals, including Starbucks and Coffee Bean. 6. There's a smoking room near C31 in Terminal 1. It's very poorly ventilated. 7. The smoking room in C11 is less crowded and more comfortable. 8. The Korean Air counter is located near Gate K8. 9.

"Already the time to go back. International Arrivals terminal is very nice, BUT we cannot buy cigarettes at the duty free since the law in Malaysia is different : you have to pay taxes here. But you can buy we you go back, at the Departures, after the immigration. There's a lot of shops, restaurants and room to smoke cigarettes after the immigration. At the departures it can be hard to find, but it exist (at the domestic terminal, which is challenging since there is a bus to catch to go and come back (15 + 15 minutes to plan, be smart because it can be stressful). All types of public transport are available. Best, fastest, cheapest (practical) I think is via KLIA ekspress train [29 MYR to go and come back to KL]. Very easy to commute with KL. Immigration services at the arrivals and at the departures are up to date, very efficient and staff is smiling, helping, caring and welcoming.","Already time go back .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) A Major Asian Hub with Smooth Connectivity | Travel Consultant Review As a travel consultant, I often recommend KLIA as a transit point or entry to Southeast Asia. Here's a breakdown of the experience: Highlights: Modern Infrastructure KLIA is clean, spacious, and well-designed. The terminalsKLIA (Main Terminal) and KLIA2 (Low-cost Terminal)are efficiently connected via train and shuttle. Connectivity Excellent connectivity via ERL (Express Rail Link) to central Kuala Lumpur in just ~30 minutes. Clear signage in English and Malay makes navigation easy for international travelers. Immigration & Security Immigration can be quick during non-peak hours, but delays are possible during busy times. Security is generally smooth and well-organized. Shopping & Amenities KLIA offers duty-free shops, premium brands, local crafts, and great food courts. Muslim prayer rooms, child play areas, lounges, and clean restrooms add to the comfort. Hospitality & Help Desks Friendly and professional staff. Help counters and digital info kiosks are helpful, especially for first-time visitors. Things to Keep in Mind: KLIA2 is separate and caters mostly to AirAsia and budget carriersplan accordingly if you have a connecting flight between KLIA and KLIA2. Transit times between gates can be long; allow extra time, especially for international connections. Consultants Tip: Use the Plaza Premium Lounge for long layoversits affordable and well-equipped.

"Kuala Lumpur international airport was one of the most magnificent airports I have been able to visit. This airport is the main hub to the huge city of Kuala Lumpur. Located almost 50km+ away from the actual city, this absolutely massive airport features numerous runways, and terminals. When we first arrived at the airport, we were relatively lost and confused! After more walking then my previous experiences in MLE, BLR, TRV, COK and CMB (all relatively smaller airports except BLR), we had to board a bus to another building in order to collect our baggage! The terminals itself are a bit well designed. The baggage collection carousels are absolutely humungous. The airport shuttle bus between terminals is a bit cramped though, when you are carrying the carry-on baggage. On the bright side, it does have seats which great. There is more greenery in the terminal than I'd have expected, it is spotless and extremely clean. There is large variety of resturants, other shops and sim/money exchange places (way more expensive than outside of airport). One thing I will highlight is the toilets are magnificent here. Whole other airports I've visited in India also have clean toilets, the hand drying systems aren't as advanced. I had a whale of a time inside the toilets in this airport, and I would rate them 5/5 star, no drama. When we went to the airport for our return flight back home, we saw more of the beautiful views and architecture of the airport. It is more easier to navigate the departures in my opinion. And, I'm sure for most people even arrivals won't be hard to navigate, it had been a while since we had flown anyways. I truly had a whale of a time in Kuala Lumpur international airport and was extremely impressed with the state of the art facilities. It also features KILA train service to the city center (KL Sentral) which is a cheaper alternative to redhing this airport (there quite far from the city). I'd love to visit Malaysia and this airport again in the future. Ps: the jetbridges are so much more convinent when boarding the airplanes! Really like those.","Kuala Lumpur international one magnificent airport I able visit . This main hub huge city Kuala Lumpur .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA)! Get ready for a travel hub that's as bustling as a beehive and as modern as a sci-fi movie set! Imagine a place where you can embark on adventures, connect with people from all corners of the globe, and maybe even find a duty-free bargain or two! Picture yourself navigating the terminals, feeling like you're starring in your own international spy thriller (minus the actual danger, hopefully!), and wondering if you should grab one last cup of Malaysian teh tarik before boarding (spoiler alert: you definitely should!) . You can explore the shops, admire the architecture, and maybe even people-watch while waiting for your flight, feeling like you're witnessing a microcosm of the world! However, lets be honest, sometimes an ""international airport"" can feel a bit like a real-life game of ""dodge the rolling suitcases,"" where you're trying to navigate the crowds while also trying to avoid getting your toes run over . And while the excitement of travel is undeniable, you might also find yourself questioning your ability to resist the urge to buy all the travel-sized snacks, especially if you're a sucker for a pre-flight treat . Overall, Kuala Lumpur International Airport offers a dynamic and exciting experience, a place where you can start or end your journey, witness the magic of travel, and maybe even find a little bit of inspiration, even if you sometimes feel like youre participating in a synchronized airport-walking marathon with a hundred other jet-setting individuals.

Cleanliness, of washrooms, and immigration waiting times are as per international standard. The airport is recognized for its range of shops and dining options. The efficiency of the train connecting the terminals is also generally well-regarded. Overall, while KLIA has some impressive features and a wide array of services, consistent maintenance and customer service appear to be areas where improvements could enhance the passenger experience. Moreover, there's not enough charging facilities and drinking water, which required an immediate attention from the airport management.","Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) great architecture main terminal ( Terminal 1 ) impressive bright , however required improvement .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport has two terminals: Terminal 1 for full-service carriers and Terminal 2 mainly for low-cost airlines, with a few exceptions. Terminal 1 has more upscale shops, while Terminal 2 offers more budget-friendly options and tends to be livelier. The toilets are better than in many countries, but dont expect too much. If you're coming from KLCC, there's not much price difference between the airport express train and Grab. Grab might be a bit more expensive, but it's usually more convenient, especially with luggage. You can take local trains and transfer to save money, but if you're carrying several suitcases, Grab is the way to go.","Kuala Lumpur International Airport two terminal : Terminal 1 full-service carrier Terminal 2 mainly low-cost airline , exception .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), Malaysia's main international airport, is located in Sepang District. I prefer flying home from this airport to Indonesia, with its hassle-free service. The restrooms are clean, the staff are polite and friendly. The high-speed train ride is also short, and the people we asked questions also gave very good answers.","Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) , Malaysia 's main international , locate Sepang District .

"Flying out or landing in KLIA2? Heres a quick dose: KLIA2 opened in 2014 to replace the old LCCT (Low-Cost Carrier Terminal)and is now the home base for airlines like AirAsia and is one of the biggest purpose-built low-cost terminals in the world! Yes..so big you can literally walk 2km (I think its more..) inside to get to your boarding gate.so be sure to wear comfy shoes or your best cushioned disco sandals (or bring a scooter?)

Get there at least 3 hours earlyimmigration lines can be sneaky long or check into the many aerohotels or capsule hotels (sama-sama) for a place to crash. Enjoy the lounge or play the Malaysian national sportand explore vast culinary from nasi lemak to homeland FuiYoh uncle Rogers fried rice and delicate steamed dumplings from din tai fung or A&W and McDonalds, doze on a massage chair or people watch till you daze if you have plenty of time to kill.

"Modern, well-connected, and spacious international airport Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is one of Southeast Asias most impressive airports. Its clean, well-organized, and offers plenty of services for both international and domestic travelers. The airport is split into two terminals: KLIA (main terminal) for full-service airlines and KLIA2 for budget carriers like AirAsia. A free shuttle bus runs between them frequently, which is super convenient. The main terminal (KLIA) is spacious with high ceilings and even includes a small indoor rainforesta really unique touch! Immigration and customs can be slow during peak hours, but the staff are generally friendly and helpful. Signage throughout the airport is clear, and its easy to find your way around. KLIA2 is more modern in terms of retail options, offering a wide variety of shops, restaurants, and lounges. It has more of a shopping mall feel and is perfect if you have a long layover. However, walking distances can be long, so plan accordingly. The KLIA Ekspres train makes travel to and from downtown Kuala Lumpur quick and easy (about 30 minutes), which is a major plus. Some downsides include occasional delays at immigration and certain gates that require shuttle buses, which isnt ideal for tired travelers. Still, overall, KLIA is a great airportefficient, comfortable, and a solid first impression of Malaysia.","Modern , well-connected , spacious international Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) one Southeast Asias impressive airport .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is a well-designed and efficient airport that offers a pleasant travel experience. The infrastructure is modern, clean, and easy to navigate, with clear signage in multiple languages and helpful staff at most points. The airport is spacious and rarely feels overcrowded, even during peak hours. Immigration and security procedures are generally smooth and well-organized. There are decent food courts, duty-free shops, and lounges, and the airport is well-connected with public transport options like the KLIA Ekspres train, buses, and Grab services. Clean washrooms and comfortable waiting areas also contribute to a positive experience. However, compared to major international airports in more developed countries like Singapores Changi or Dubai International, KLIA still falls short in terms of variety and scale of shopping, entertainment, and dining options. While it covers the basics well, theres limited innovation or unique features that stand out globally. Transit experience, especially during late hours, can feel a bit dull due to reduced services. Overall, KLIA is a solid international airport that serves its purpose well, especially for regional travel, but there is room to enhance its offerings and compete with the worlds leading hubs.","Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) well-designed efficient offer pleasant travel experience .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport has two terminals: Terminal 1 for full-service carriers and Terminal 2 mainly for low-cost airlines, with a few exceptions. Terminal 1 has more upscale shops, while Terminal 2 offers more budget-friendly options and tends to be livelier. The toilets are better than in many countries, but dont expect too much. If you're coming from KLCC, there's not much price difference between the airport express train and Grab. Grab might be a bit more expensive, but it's usually more convenient, especially with luggage. You can take local trains and transfer to save money, but if you're carrying several suitcases, Grab is the way to go.","Kuala Lumpur International Airport two terminal : Terminal 1 full-service carrier Terminal 2 mainly low-cost airline , exception .

"My sincere gratitude to the KLIA airport screening team for your outstanding assistance in helping me to recover my lost watch! The entire incident happened at the last screening section before the boarding gate C26 while I was boarding my flight (PR 8526) back to Manila on 1st May 2025. I put my watch in an empty tray for sreening, however, I forgot to collect my watch after the screening. After about 15 minutes at the boarding area, that was when I noticed I had not collected my watch, I approached the screening staff. The staff didn't take my concern in a perfunctory manner but in fact patiently asked me about the physical design of my watch and what time I put my watch for screening. More than 4 staff really hunted high and low, left no stone unturned at the entire screening area to recover my lost watch.The staff also immediately coordinated with surveillance team, however, without any optimistic results of my lost watch, I had to board the aircraft without any further delay as the boarding gate was about to close. The staff then got my mobile number and email address. When I didn't hold out much hope on that, the airport staff handed my watch to me at my seat. Dear KLIA team, your swift action, professionalism, teamwork, and dedication to passengers care truly stood out and made a stressful experience to a posive one!

"If you are looking for the capital airport of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur International Airport, this is definitely the one for you. It is big and spacious. It is a little far from the city, so please be careful when traveling. And don't make a mistake. It takes quite a while to get to the city. They use the windows well, and blend in well with nature. The facilities are also substantial, so you won't get bored even if you come a little early. If you don't arrive two hours before an international flight, you won't be able to deal with any sudden problems. I tend to be lazy and think, ""I can play a little more after that, right?!"", but if you consider the cost and time lost when you don't fly, it's better to go early. There are two airports in Kuala Lumpur, but the one in the city is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport. It does have international flights, but it only covers a very limited area. In terms of image, it's in a position similar to Osaka Itami Airport. It is unbeatable in terms of convenience, and if you live in the capital, this is definitely the best choice. It was a good idea to build a larger airport because it had become too small, but demolishing it would cause other problems, so they decided to leave it as it is.","If look capital Malaysia , Kuala Lumpur International Airport , definitely one .

"If you are looking for the capital airport of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur International Airport, this is definitely the one for you. It is big and spacious. It is a little far from the city, so please be careful when traveling. And don't make a mistake. It takes quite a while to get to the city. They use the windows well, and blend in well with nature. The facilities are also substantial, so you won't get bored even if you come a little early. If you don't arrive two hours before an international flight, you won't be able to deal with any sudden problems. I tend to be lazy and think, ""I can play a little more after that, right?!"", but if you consider the cost and time lost when you don't fly, it's better to go early. There are two airports in Kuala Lumpur, but the one in the city is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport. It does have international flights, but it only covers a very limited area. In terms of image, it's in a position similar to Osaka Itami Airport. It is unbeatable in terms of convenience, and if you live in the capital, this is definitely the best choice. It was a good idea to build a larger airport because it had become too small, but demolishing it would cause other problems, so they decided to leave it as it is.","If look capital Malaysia , Kuala Lumpur International Airport , definitely one .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) A Major Asian Hub with Smooth Connectivity | Travel Consultant Review As a travel consultant, I often recommend KLIA as a transit point or entry to Southeast Asia.

The terminalsKLIA (Main Terminal) and KLIA2 (Low-cost Terminal)are efficiently connected via train and shuttle. Connectivity Excellent connectivity via ERL (Express Rail Link) to central Kuala Lumpur in just ~30 minutes. Clear signage in English and Malay makes navigation easy for international travelers. Immigration & Security Immigration can be quick during non-peak hours, but delays are possible during busy times. Security is generally smooth and well-organized.

"My experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was generally very positive. The airport is modern, spacious, and well-organized. However, during arrival, there was a bit of confusion at the passport control stage. The signage wasnt very clear, especially when it came to directing passengers with foreign passports versus those with Malaysian ones they go through different gates. Additionally, all visitors are required to fill out a form regarding their stay in Malaysia. Thankfully, there are enough computers to do this at the airport ( you can do it on your device), but the process can take a little time. It requires having all your accommodation details ready, including the full address, which isnt always at your fingertips after a long flight. The form could definitely be a bit more user-friendly. On the other hand, the departure process was fantastic quick, smooth, and with no queues at all. It was honestly one of the most stress-free airport departures I've ever experienced. The airport wasnt overcrowded, which made everything feel relaxed and efficient. All in all, KLIA delivers a pleasant travel experience, especially if youre well-prepared on arrival. I'd definitely be happy to fly through here again!","My experience Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) generally positive . The modern , spacious , well-organized .

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is one of the most well-organized and clean airports Ive experienced in Southeast Asia. The moment you land, the airport greets you with a sense of calm, spacious design, and a touch of Malaysian hospitality. I arrived via an international flight at KLIA Terminal 1, and the immigration process was smooth and efficient, with polite officers and clear signage everywhere. The airport is modern and beautifully maintained, with plenty of seating areas, clean washrooms, and good connectivity to the city via the KLIA Ekspres train. It took me just under 30 minutes to reach KL Sentral, which was incredibly convenient. The shopping and dining options are diversefrom local Malaysian snacks to international chains and luxury brands. My only issue was the aerotrain between the main terminal and the satellite building being out of service, which meant taking shuttle buses instead. Also, baggage claim took a bit longer than expected. Despite that, the overall experience was pleasant. KLIA2, which I visited on a previous trip, was a bit more chaotic due to the budget airline crowd, but still fairly efficient. Overall, KLIA is a great international hub, well worth 4 stars, and Id happily fly through here again","Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) one well-organized clean airport Ive experience Southeast Asia .

In addition, I lost the check-boarding document and they asked me for it, which made me happy because in Bangkok I lost it and what a hassle they gave me at customs.","For one large airport heavy traffic , I surprise I arrive , register Nmcd , I think online registration passport date , go physical control passport scanned control passport ...

Plenty of dining options, duty-free shopping, and comfortable lounges. Free Wi-Fi that actually works well. What Could Be Better: KLIA2 can feel a bit chaotic and crowded during peak hours. Transit between KLIA1 and KLIA2 can take ~1015 minutes via shuttle/train.","Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) Quick Review KLIA one Southeast Asias busy modern airport , offer smooth efficient travel experience .

"Arrived here around 3am and I was amazed because of the hassle-free queueing and not much documents needed but also very secured and organized, the airport seemed to be abandoned but in reality every transaction is really fast. We have to present the MDAC to the officer and I had it finished before my flight.","Arrived around 3am I amaze hassle-free queueing much document need also secured organize , seem abandon reality every transaction really fast .

"KLIA (Kula Lumpur International AirPort) Terminal 1 is a well-designed, modern airport with spacious interiors, smooth immigration, and a good mix of dining and shopping options. The architecture is impressive, and premium lounges offer a relaxing experience for long layovers. However, the Aerotrain is currently down, so shuttle buses can cause delays during transfers. Also, limited water dispensers and gate specific security checks can be inconvenient for travelers. Overall, a clean, efficient, and traveler friendly airport just allow some extra time and keep a water bottle handy!","KLIA ( Kula Lumpur International AirPort ) Terminal 1 well-designed , modern spacious interior , smooth immigration , good mix dining shopping option .

"Do plan ahead of time as there are 2 rounds of baggage screening. There are plenty of food options at the airport mall, near departure area and inside the transit area. You can refill water outside of the toilets after you pass the 2nd baggage screening. For arrival, I found myself walking a lot just to get to the baggage collection area. Easily a 10 mins walk.","Do plan ahead time 2 round baggage screening . There plenty food option mall , near departure area inside transit area .

"Flying out or landing in KLIA2? Heres a quick dose: KLIA2 opened in 2014 to replace the old LCCT (Low-Cost Carrier Terminal)and is now the home base for airlines like AirAsia and is one of the biggest purpose-built low-cost terminals in the world! Yes..so big you can literally walk 2km (I think its more..) inside to get to your boarding gate.so be sure to wear comfy shoes or your best cushioned disco sandals (or bring a scooter?) Gateway@KLIA2 is connected to the terminal, packed with food, stores & even a grocery! Its like a mini shopping mall with gates, to the extent you could arrive with just credit and dress up from top to bottom complete with rolling luggage to rock the day. Flying via KLIA2 makes you an early bird even if you are a marathon runner (kudos to you if you have pre-checked in and zero check in luggage). Get there at least 3 hours earlyimmigration lines can be sneaky long or check into the many aerohotels or capsule hotels (sama-sama) for a place to crash. Enjoy the lounge or play the Malaysian national sportand explore vast culinary from nasi lemak to homeland FuiYoh uncle Rogers fried rice and delicate steamed dumplings from din tai fung or A&W and McDonalds, doze on a massage chair or people watch till you daze if you have plenty of time to kill. Currency exchanges are all around (RHBs rate is not bad) KLIA Ekspres from KL Sentral gets you there fast & comfy. E-hailing is a buzz with tonnes of queues at level 1 Whether youre heading off to new adventures or coming home to Nasi Lemak, KLIA2s got your back.","Flying land KLIA2 ?

"The airport is modern, clean, and well-equipped with lots of shops and dining options. It looks great and feels spacious. However, the layout can be a little confusing at times especially when transferring between terminals or figuring out immigration and baggage. Still, staff are helpful and things generally run smoothly. Once you get the hang of it, its a pretty solid airport!","The modern , clean , well-equipped lot shop din option .
