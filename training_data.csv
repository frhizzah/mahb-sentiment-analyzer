"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was nothing short of frustrating. From the airline to the moment I arrived, the service was abysmally slow, and the staff was unhelpful. Immigration staff, in particular, were rude and disrespectful, making an already stressful experience far worse.

The flight was plagued with significant delays, and constant gate changes, making the entire experience chaotic. The in-flight safety video was unprofessional and disturbing, especially for young passengers. This attempt at engagement was tasteless and unnecessary.

Additionally, the constant gate changes and flight delays created confusion and anxiety throughout my entire time at the airport. Having to take a bus between terminals was highly inconvenient and only added to the frustration.

What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: “We hope you’ve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality.” Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered.

Given this experience, I will never fly with Malaysian Airlines or visit Malaysia again and I certainly won't be encouraging my friends or family to visit.",Negative
"Very slow immigration service at depature and arrival times
Knowing everyone has flight to board still they have very few staff which also take alot of time",Negative
"Gate C is too far away, and the security check in front of the gate shortens the time spent at the airport, so it's hard to enjoy it.",Negative
"I’ve traveled through KLIA countless times, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading.

With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where it’s due- the new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well designed, good ventilation, clean and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail space—why so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradise—why isn’t KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign coffe chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti?

Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jean’s. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysia’s rich culinary diversity?- take a page out of Jakarta or Singapore airport.

To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (I’ve lost count how long I’ve waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an ‘Ask Me For Help’ staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone. Customer service should be better than this!

KLIA, let’s do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers.

P.S. if you’re ever at the Satellite building of KLIA terminal 1 (after the shuttle service), I highly recommend visiting the Jungle Boardwalk - a small beautiful green forest in the middle of the building 😄 I always look forward to visiting it if my Gate is located there. 🌴🌳🌴",Negative
"Edit:DO NOT USE GRAB ehailing, especially advance booking. You'll get the most greedy and unfriendly driver ever.

Use BOLT.
Your welcome for cheaper ride.

bypass airport expensive surcharge by using trains. Use the ERL and drop off at Salak Tinggi. And you can get cheaper ehailing ride.

Dear traveler, do NOT use ""taxi"" that waiting at the airport. They ""offer"" you a ride for rm300-400. You should only get a ride via ehailing service, I recommended BOLT. A ride from airport to Kuala Lumpur should not exceed RM80, MAX. If a 4 seats it RM50 MAX. If you book an ehailing, driver can't ask more money from you. Pay what in the app. If driver ask for more money, record them & car number plate, and go to police station to submit a report. Those driver who doesn't use the app / ask for more money is the betrayal to Malaysia.",Negative

"It is a world famous airport, and has multiple connectivity to go to different countries. But very normal( or less) facilities and without Money Transfer store at L10-L20 gates. I was very disappointed with these at these gates. There should be improvement.",Negative
inside are allllll ok but the outside sucks especially the arrival hall. some cars parked without drivers on the left lane and causing traffic jams to the other two lanes. please do something to cars that park on the left lane. so selfish. tolong la tunggu kat tempat lain dulu. security only ask to go foward to the other two lane but did not ask left lane to move foward.  👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻,Negative

To Entrance to Boarding Gate you have to walk a lot..And A bit difficult to find ways,Negative
"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling.  This looks fancy but very old school.
Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating

Very confusing direction or procedure. I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers
When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products.
Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority.

As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go.

Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there.

I went other less modern airport like ho chi Ming city or in Istanbul. Where still have better experience than in Malaysia",Negative
"I would like to give 0 out of 5 stars but cannot give to it.The toilet staff in KLIA 1(malay lady) besides costa coffee make me feel mad.A cleaner there,Hope that can fired she.I am a travelers and when I using toilet she mcm marah marah tak mau kerja.if u don't want to work better u stay at home right?",Negative
"We went to terminal 2 to get our flights, very disappointed with Air Asia, they weren’t helpful at all! Despite having kids, still we were made to wait for so much time to check in our luggage, they kept directing us towards self check in but that wasn’t working! When we addressed our issue to the staffs they weren’t friendly , we were made to wait for more than 45 mins just to check in 3 luggages! It wasn’t crowded also! Also they charged so much if there is extra luggage! Very dissatisfied and Very poor Organization! Despite reaching the airport very much in advance, because of the inefficient Air Asia team, we were so delayed. Finally by the time we cleared immigration and security checks we barely had 15 mins before they closed the gates, we literally had to run all the way to bay L16 while carrying our kids and carry-on bags to catch the flight. Please don’t book Air Asia if you happen to have extra luggage, better choose it only if you have carry-on bags less than 7kg, totally not kid friendly and not customer friendly as well!",Negative
"It's a gigantic airport, but unlike other mega-airports, it's not easy to find your way around. Fortunately, the police and airport staff are very friendly and helpful. But you have to be prepared for time and take things slowly. To board a domestic flight from an international airport, it took us almost an hour, including the transfer (by bus), then the elevator, then reprinting the boarding pass (because the previous one no longer worked), then finding the domestic flight exit, then going through carry-on baggage control (you have to remove all electronic devices from your backpack, unlike at other airports where they are checked inside your luggage). In a word, take your time and take your time!",Negative
"Actually, it shouldn't even get a star. The immigration queue is very long. Only a few counters are open and very slow. Almost missed the flight even though there was another hour before boarding time. The airport layout is also terrible and complicated.

On the way there, I had to take a bus from the terminal building in the middle of the airport to the main passenger building. The wait was long and the walk was very far.

The bathroom was dirty and smelled bad. The baggage check point in front of the gate was slow and unorganized.",Negative
"Exhausting.. you need to have at least a year of airport work experience to just transit through this airport. It took nearly 2 hrs from landing to sitting down at our gate. So much is automated, and very few staff members to help, so when something goes wrong - like when the self bag-drop off machine stops working.. with one of our bags halfway through the conveyor, we were left for ages, not knowing what to do. So many more hurdles to jump such as filling in an MDAC, yes, we were asked to fill it in on-line at Siem Reap, but thought it couldn't possibly be for us as so many 'mandatory' boxes were irrelevant to us. However, at the airport, they insisted we filled it in with a bunch of false information, i.e. the address where we would be staying (had to put in an they address provided.. which was the airport's address) a waste of time, as we felt we could miss our connecting flight. We also had to create our own baggage tags, then TWO separate baggage screenings - so unnecessary. So many options of queues without clear instructions, so many people, so much walking - it just seemed chaotic. It's not my favourite airport. If we weren't so tired.. we had been travelling all day, I would have said a pretty average airport.",Negative
To be very frank. I just came from Singapore airport and back to malaysia. It is heaven and hell comparison. Why the management took for long to upgrade the train? I paid premier for MAS and I got s*** service from start to the end. I gotta wait 30 mins for my bus ride to the main terminal. What a joke.,Negative
"Average airport, but pricey. Coffee, sandwich, travel necessities - be prepared to pay more. 2 coffees plus 2 sandwiches equaled almost RM120. At least there are some dispensers for free water.

Boarding is very slow due to extra security checks at the gates.

Plan at least another 30-40 minutes (the difference between the boarding time on your ticket vs the actual boarding time) for this second and very slow check.

Once you’re through this gate security check, there’s a waiting area with no toilets and no water. So please take care is your needs BEFORE queueing for the gate security check.

Second, the gate security check is hyper sensitive. My wife’s passport - which she held in her hand - triggered it. They make you take off shoes and belts if those contain small metal bits. My empty laptop backpack went through the scanner twice and I have no idea why… 🤷🏼‍♂️",Negative
Who knew that you have to take a bus to C gates    give yourself enough time,Negative
It is usually tiring to transfer you by bus from one hall to another and you may make a mistake and you will be back outside because there is only one and two,Negative
"(Emerites specifically from KL).. KL is a beautiful airport, super clean, very convenient with English signs everywhere- with many options for drink and food land side before security - coffee, mcdonald’s, taco bell and high end malaysian restaurants. NOTE: the few Emirates flights that leave from here, despite what you may read, have NO bag drop, have no kiosks to print your bag tag or boarding pass, and if you are checking a bag you have to stand in the forever line with people going to Dubai with 5 giant suitcases. Not having an Emirates bag drop or kiosk is ridiculous. NOTE: Terminal C gates - the entire terminal stinks of cigarettes and the none care security has for looking at carry on’s is terrifying. Many didn’t even look at the screens, they were too busy dillydallying.",Negative
Smoking area only in building C.,Negative
You go through 2 securities and end up in area that says duty free. Bought 4 waters thinking i could bring on the plane (which were overpriced) and just before the gate there is another security and they say your not allowed to bring water through. Then you end up in a area with 1-2 shops with little option to buy drinks.,Negative
"Honestly, if I could give this airport a -1, I would. Very slow, very disorganised, awful attitude. Very lazy. Very rude and disrespectful.  Will never return, nor use such airlines again! Absolutely disgusting!",Negative
Cannot cope the capacity,Negative
"Beautiful but very far from the city, which you can reach by express train (about €11) or by taxi/grab (there is no Uber in Malaysia)",Negative
"This was our arrival airport in Malaysia from Paris and our departure airport for Langkawi. It's about an hour from downtown Kuala Lumpur.
I find that there are some areas where there aren't enough flight display screens.
There aren't enough seats/chairs in the boarding areas, which makes it crowded.
Everything is done differently from other well-known airports, and not for the better.",Negative
Good internet connection but very limited and friendly staff and there is limited seats for the people to sit. Sorry but an international airport should have enought seats,Negative
Not enough chairs near the gates before security check. Food is unusually expensive and of so-so quality.,Negative
Have to take shuttle bus to get to my gate. No water dispenser after security gate. Have to wait until you get on the plane.,Negative
"This airport needs water dispensers after every security screening. If you must insist on screening at the gate, you must allow people to access free and drinkable water.
I have been coming here for 20 years and still yet to see this small uplift.",Negative
"Worst airport I’ve ever been at. When I landed I stood in line for 1,5 hours at immigration!! Landed in terminal 2 and my next flight was from terminal 1, the shuttle bus took 20-30 minutes. After I checked in for my next line I had to stand another hour  to get thru immigration??? I almost missed my flight, my layover was 3,5-4 hours and I still had to run to the plane when it was boarding!! People working at the airport are not helpful. Very ineffective airport!!
They need to get more people at work.",Negative
"Get out of the plane, hand over everything that security wants for themselves, and get back on the plane.",Negative
The road from the apron to the airport is too far.,Negative
"Looks like a lot of construction going on in the terminal, that makes it feel chaotic. But overall it is a smooth experience from gate to taxi.",Negative
"Unfortunately, my experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was disappointing. Here are a few points that struck me negatively:
1. Strict baggage control, but not consistent:
My hand luggage was accurately weighed, and even though it was only slightly over 7kg, I was told to pay extra. At the same time, the Malaysian woman in front of me, weighing almost 8 kg, was allowed to walk away - that felt unfair.
2. Poor Signage:
Some gates had no numbers, which was extremely confusing. It was difficult to find the right path.
3. Lack of seating:
There were no seats at the gate, which made the wait unnecessarily tiring.
4. Inadequate Toilets:
The women's restrooms were a mess - I waited in line for over 30 minutes and when it was finally my turn, they were dirty. The men apparently had enough toilets as there were no queues.

Unfortunately, the airport was the worst I've ever been to.",Negative
"The first time I came here, I felt very bad. I didn’t expect to enter the country because I didn’t speak English very well. I was called a fool by the immigration staff at the airport, and the staff was very impatient. I thought it was such a solution, but they didn’t help us solve it in the end. They just asked us to leave and go somewhere else. The attitude was very bad and unfriendly.",Negative
Non cooperative attitude.,Negative
Coming back to KLIA 1 after so long. As usual very crowded,Negative
"Most idiotic system I've ever heard of which warrants this airport getting a one star from me. So you go through initial security and I totally understand why you aren't allowed liquids. However, after doing initial security, we filled our refillable water bottles at the designated stations in the airport outside of our gate and then had to go through a second round of security to get into the waiting area for our gate. We were made to empty out our water bottles........no justification. This is the most stupid thing I've ever heard. You might say oh but you can get just get little water bottles on the airplane but what's the point if I've got 1L of water already on me. Way more convenient, not to mention better for the environment by avoiding unnecessary plastic. KL Airport run by total idiots.",Negative
The airport with the worst service during my travels..the staff are not friendly and do not solve problems quickly.,Negative
"My departures gate changed 4 times in 3 hours, and the disorder of the gate number very complicated things in that matter",Negative
"You lose a fully paid vacation day, including a taxi, because their system reports errors in your passport or visa that don't exist. It's a shame I've never seen before. The number of people who have encountered these ""errors"" and waited HOURS in line without the opportunity to use the bathroom or buy food or drinks makes you realize the problem isn't with the travelers, but with the airport. Extremely long lines with only one person checking passports.
A disgrace.",Negative
"I've used it several times for travel/transit.
For some reason, liquids are confiscated at the boarding gate (just before boarding the plane) instead of at the first gate! ! Drinks and liquids purchased at the airport, as well as water filled at water points at the airport, will also be confiscated! Are you going to take care of me? 😒That's why I can't bring drinking water on the plane...that's weird! 🙂‍↔️
Take care~😇",Negative
I hate it why do I have to even say this customer service is bad like no business they are treating us like we are slaves. Staffs so rude and won't let me even go to the lounge as when I wanted to check in she shouted on me like I killed her family and she took my passport and she hurt my hand injury in the plane is bad they didn't even do anything.,Negative
"Since the sale of cigarettes and tobacco is legal in the country, there should be smoking areas at every Terminal. Smoking is Legal and it would be a good thing, in 2025, not to make smokers who travel feel ghettoized. You cannot make them spend hours in front of the gates without ensuring a smoking area. It is embarrassing for a world capital. Those who smoke in designated areas do not cause any harm to non-smokers: following and pursuing these embarrassing policies is only harmful.",Negative
"Inside KLIA airport, there are no toilets at the last gate for departing passengers and there are very limited seats in front of the gate. Passengers have to stand for a very long time to enter the last gate.",Negative
"The shopping area here is great, with plenty of options—especially restaurants. However, the transit experience could be much more comfortable. After arriving from one flight, passengers who need to connect must exit the terminal, take a shuttle bus, and endure a long walk. Not the most traveler-friendly setup. As for the immigration officers… let’s just say the atmosphere felt quite intimidating.",Negative
Poor immigration,Negative
"Terrible in everything. Baggage management simply embarrassing. From the moment you leave the main airline like Emirates and end up in the hands of their Air Asia the goal becomes to make you pay for extra baggage, do self check in, board your own baggage and they are also rude.
Last trip to Asia",Negative
"Exactly about a week ago, when I was returning to my country from KLIA 1, I had an unpleasant experience with the X-ray staff at the gate, who had no manners!

During immigration and security checks, I threw away my little brother's water bottle because I knew that international flights don't allow drinks exceeding 100ml.

After that, I saw a water dispenser before entering the gate.
I filled it up there...
But as I was about to enter the gate, the unmannered officer yelled at me and told me to throw the water in the toilet, using a rude tone!

And even worse, when I threw the water in the toilet, my mother was also scolded by the X-ray staff... Crazy, they really have no manners towards their elders!

If drinks aren't allowed in the waiting room, please provide them in the waiting room... Are your airport staff going to take responsibility if we get thirsty? The airport has the worst and strangest regulations I've ever visited... So different from Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand! Euwwwwww🙄🙄",Negative
"Unfortunately, there are still no 0 stars on Google!

Most of the staff were very friendly, only the ladies at C15 for boarding today's TK0061 were the worst! Rude and mean.

The fact that a proper security check only takes place immediately before entering the gate is completely pointless and simply stupid. There are no longer any opportunities to refill your water bottle or buy anything for a long flight at the gate itself.

Whoever came up with this system will hopefully pay for it. Especially since it's many times more expensive to have staff and equipment at every gate.

Regards!",Negative
"KLIA2 is by far the most disappointing terminal, starting with the immigration service, which completely kills any desire to ever return here.
We’ve been to Malaysia many times, arriving through KLIA, but we’ve never seen such chaos. Over 300 people in line, and only 8 counters open - and working incredibly slowly! We waited in line for 1.5 (!) hours.
What’s the point of filling out the online arrival form if immigration officers still spend 4-7 minutes on each tourist?
After standing in line for over 1.5 hours and watching how the officers worked, we were left very disappointed. Even worse was how immigration officers treated Asian travelers with darker skin - their gestures were so disrespectful, it was truly unpleasant to witness.

Ah, yes! And before departure immigration process took 30 minutes at 6:30am.

A reasonable processing time at passenger-respecting airports around the world is 15–20 minutes.
But not at KLIA2 - here, the staff act like they’re doing you a favor by letting you enter or leave the country.
What a shame!",Negative
"Layout is confusing and staff are horrible, especially the immigration staff. We were directed to join the family line, only to be told by the immigration officer in the rudest manner, that only one adult could accompany the baby, and the rest of the family had to queue up normally. I have never experienced this at any airport before, and it happened twice! It's no wonder that tourists from the Gulf no longer like to visit Malaysia if this is how you treat guests.",Negative
"Horrible experience!!!  This is the worst airport I have been to. There is no seating area before immigration. The way the flight schedule is displayed is not user friendly. Announced in the terminal 2 building are inaudible, the flight schedule is so dispersed and no power outlets for chatting only USB type A. Airline kiosk staff is sassy . I missed my flight because of severe logistic issues. Had to stay is all night at the airport to catch h the next flight. No flights schedule displayed at  terminal H10 . It was like a ghost town. I never want to come here again. I was at the airport from 2:00pm and have to leave at 7:04 am just because of poor planning and communication.",Negative
"It's still a great airport that meet the customers demand, but there are some run down facility and hardware, such as rugged carpet in the arrival, some run down toilets with dim lamps. However the immigration section is seems to improve",Negative
Too bad there's no autogate,Negative
"This is Malaysia's largest airport and main gateway for overseas visitors to enter Malaysia. At peak times, be prepared to wait a very long time for your checked in luggage to come out. The aerotrain connecting the terminals is still out of order.",Negative
"Extremely hot and poor ventilation. Definitely feels like a developing nation's airport.

Immigration is the worst. The slowest in the world I think.,Negative
"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was nothing short of frustrating. From the airline to the moment I arrived, the service was abysmally slow, and the staff was unhelpful.

The immigration officers are rude and disrespectful, making an already stressful experience far worse. To be honest, it felt like the staff were completely uninterested in their job, and some even seemed to resent being there.

When my family arrived at the immigration counter, the officer seemed confused when we asked whether he wanted to see our MDAC or passports first. He glanced at our passports and then repeatedly said, ""You don’t look British."" When we asked why he was being rude, he flew into a rage and yelled, ""What do you mean I am being rude! You’re not welcome here. Go back to where you came from.""

At first, I thought I could be overreacting, but as the situation unfolded, it made me wonder if this could be a case of racial bias, especially toward darker-skinned people. It’s hard not to perceive this as racism when the treatment felt so harsh and unwarranted. But then, a white female tourist recounted her own experience, and she was visibly shaken, nearly on the verge of tears. She too had been yelled at and bullied by the Malaysian airport staff. To make matters worse, I also witnessed an Indian woman being denied entry to the bathroom just to retrieve her bag. After numerous attempts she managed to get them back.

This made me realize that it wasn’t just about skin colour—though it was hard not to make that connection—but rather a broader issue with the staff’s attitude toward tourist and travellers. The customer service here has drastically declined. This used to be a place where visitors were welcomed with warmth and respect, but unfortunately, that’s no longer the case. It’s a shame to see such a decline.

In Malaysia, government jobs, including those at airports prioritize ethnic Malays over Indian and Chinese Malays. As a result, some government positions, such as immigration officers or airport staff, may be filled based on ethnicity rather than merit or qualifications. Due to this, individuals in these roles might lack the necessary qualifications or passion for the job, which can sometimes be reflected in their job performance and attitude.

What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: “We hope you’ve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality.” Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered.

Given this experience, I will never fly with Malaysian Airlines or visit Malaysia again and I certainly won't be encouraging my friends or family to visit. Avoid countries that do not respect and appreciate tourist coming to help their economy!",Negative
"After 2 weeks of trip in Malaysia, I headed to KLIA terminal 2 for my next destination.

Due to the unexpected flight delay, I had to wait 7 hours, outside of security check points. I was quite surprised that this big international airport doesn’t have a single seat for public who have to wait for flights. Only way to find seats were eating or drinking in the restaurant. It was very disappointing experience.

I wish KLIA terminal 2 make seats for public outside of the security check points, so tourists who couldn't check-in yet can take some break before they check-in.",Negative
"I have nothing good to say about Kuala Lumpur. Never recommend going through this airport. We had a 2 hour lay over coming back from Thailand to Perth. The plane left 1 hour early no emails no messages nothing to let us no. We go to the terminal no one was there. I then asked 4 different security, workers at the airport for help even the ones that could speak English didn’t want to help us at all. We walk around with tears for more than an hour trying to find where to go. Instead they sent us to the wrong area told us x1",Negative
"The route to baggage claim upon arrival is quite confusing. When leaving the country, your baggage will be inspected twice, so it's a good idea to keep this in mind and hurry up a bit.",Negative
Ordinary airport,Negative
Electronic passport control on arrival doesn't work properly for international flights arrivals. Result in constant ques in the airport in immigration 2 hours standing in a que. I have noticed that it is working on arraval from Airasia terminal only.,Negative
"Well, this airport is so outdated and crappy. All the staff are very slow, I barely missed my flight because of them. They are just like lazy dogs or hate their jobs. They should be trained to be more efficient.",Negative
"Perhaps KL staff management could explain why passengers transferring who've already been through security at Heathrow airport need to go through additional security at the gate. And if you're going to take water off people, why don't you at least provide water at the gate so people can refill their bottles. Have you tried a 13-hour flight with no water? Try being a customer on your own service and see how it feels. Customer experience level 0.",Negative
"This is the worst airport in the world. The check-in system often crashes, the staff are arrogant, and many security channels are not working. Due to the backwardness of the airport, there are frequent delays. However, AirAsia still takes off. I suspect it's really a primitive tribe.",Negative
"Dear Airport Authority,

I am writing to formally express my disappointment regarding my experience at KLIA 2 on 28 January 2025 at 3:38 AM while waiting for the departure hall to open.

One of your customer service staff (a Chinese male) informed us that the hall would open at 3:00 AM. However, when the hall was still closed at 3:10 AM, we asked another staff member (a Malay female), who then told us it would open at 4:00 AM. When we mentioned that her colleague had stated an earlier opening time, her response was:

""Then you ikut apa yang dia cakap lah.""

When we further inquired about the actual opening time, she dismissively said:

""Then you tunggu hall buka lah.""

I find this attitude highly unprofessional and unacceptable, especially for airport staff who are expected to assist passengers courteously. Providing inconsistent information and responding rudely to simple inquiries only creates confusion and frustration.

I urge you to look into this matter and ensure that staff are properly trained to handle customer queries in a respectful and professional manner. Additionally, clear and accurate information regarding the departure hall opening time should be provided to avoid unnecessary inconvenience for passengers.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this issue and look forward to your response.",Negative
"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?!

First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. I’ve traveled through many large airports, but I’ve never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that… but what came next was even worse.

After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub.

We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (we’re used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle.

Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we weren’t allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel.

In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there.

Oh and did I mention that the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration? I had such a hard time to book the Grab and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, because there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!!

This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia. I've never thought an airport would affect my will to visit a country but here we are.",Negative
"Overall ok.

I don't know if I can't see it, but I'm at the Gate B4 domestic departure, and I can't find a rubbish bin to throw my trash. I see a few rubbish laying around, I assume they also can't find a rubbish bin. Please have this in all your gates, and all around the airport. People don't want to litter, but there's not enough rubbish bin around. Will update more.",Negative
"Everything is nice and new, but they make you throw away any liquid at the gate just before boarding the plane.
Disgraceful.",Negative
Staff don’t have a clue and it’s not particularly clean,Negative
Terrible toilets condition.  Long que at immigration,Negative
"I rarely give 1-star reviews, but this airport truly deserves it. The boarding process is poor. The security machines are outdated and the taxis are old and dirty, showing no signs of improvement in decades. Even the so-called premium taxis are worse than budget taxis in many other countries. After a post-COVID renovation, they still use manual water taps. Isn’t contactless supposed to matter after COVID? Hard to believe this place gets 4 or 5 stars.",Negative
The transit train is still not ready. The bus driver who drove between satellite and main terminal are reckless.,Negative
"Very large airport. Efficient check-in, immigration and security clearance. However the waiting area is the worst compared to other international airports I the region. There are not enough seats and restrooms near the gates after security. It doesn't seem they want tourists to come back",Negative
"Immigration took a long time, the queue was very long, the connection was intermittent, the officers were mean and angry, it was not clear, the gate took a long time to open, there were very few seats, many people sat on the floor, very inappropriate, very disturbing to my activities and other people's activities, the connection was very bad, often disconnected, everything is complete at this airport, really annoying",Negative
"It's a gigantic airport, but unlike other mega-airports, it's not easy to find your way around. Fortunately, the police and airport staff are very friendly and helpful. But you have to be prepared for time and take things slowly. To board a domestic flight from an international airport, it took us almost an hour, including the transfer (by bus), then the elevator, then reprinting the boarding pass (because the previous one no longer worked), then finding the domestic flight exit, then going through carry-on baggage control (you have to remove all electronic devices from your backpack, unlike at other airports where they are checked inside your luggage). In a word, take your time and take your time!",Negative
If u fly domestic u will have difficulty to refill water at KLIA2,Negative
"Not enough counter, always long queue to check in.",Negative
"Very badly organised, you go trough security twice and ac barely working. People cutting in lines all the time. Of course not enough place to sit in gate, hard to fin a charging spot and you are greeted by rude Air Asia staff enforcing payment for every possible gram beyond limit.",Negative
"1. Airport (specially departure area) has limited food options/vendors, resulting in high prices of available food items compared to market.
2. Flights of Air Asia and Gatik Airlines (Malindo) intend delayed without timely inform8ng passengers resulting in un-necessary waiting time",Negative
"An irritating airport experience at KLIA1. Making people pour away water due to security right at the gate, then providing no refill stations after security is ridiculous.

The whole terminal experience is irritating from start to finish.

Provide refil taps.",Negative
"The airport is constantly under construction, but it's easy to navigate, and the staff is helpful. However, the immigration counters are very meticulous, and it sometimes takes up to an hour to be admitted.

I've never had this much hastle and wasted time to manage to exit an airport, oh yeah, and the airport is so far away from the city it took us 90 minutes to reach the hotel (with zero traffic after midnight) knowing this, the designers still decided to add a mall to make your trip even slower!

"KLIA is an international airport that always feels like a poor budget airport that is falling apart. Ironically, it is overstaffed by an army of smiling greeters.

On Sunday, 22 June 2025, we saw water dispenser stations broken and unrepaired. ""Free drinks"" stations abandoned, unmanned.

The only smoking room in the airport is a filthy room covered in black soot: incredibly smelly, no ventilation systems, piles of ash, trash, and butts all over. Warning: Enter at your own risk.

The aerotrain was being repaired, and although bus services were provided, no signs were available to passengers on where it is. Bus services from the sub terminal to the main terminal were not easy to find.

Tragically, the contrast between KLIA and KLIA2 (the latter an actual budget terminal that's well designed, modern, clean, and efficient) has never been clearer.",Negative
"Once touted as a modern design airport with state of the art facilities, this has fallen far where maintenance has taken a back seat.   The train which services between the terminals has not run for 2 years at least, the air-conditioning is either turned to a low level or not functioning cos I was sweating profusely while waiting in line (check in).   There's more to add to the list of woes, but anyway,  it is a point of transit, and it works.     Could really do with sprucing up. After all, it's the first impression of our country for millions of visitors.",Negative
Don't get a transfer flight here. It is a joke. Bad signage and the terminals are incredibly far apart.,Negative
"Be sure to confirm the location of the terminal where you are flying. . Otherwise, the distance between the first flight and the second flight is really far enough...",Negative
"The airport use to be one of the best airports around some countries.

Since 1998 the airport management has not even changed the fans in some of  the smoking rooms , very dirty very bad condition,  one of the worst around the world.

The train has been taking more it should to be renovated.

The First impression to KLIA is 1/10

Malaysia is tourism country and the airport doesn't help that.
The immigration line up ( in and out ) is really  a mess .. I seen many time people missing the flights due to the long line ups.

I wish it's solved ASAP.",Negative
"Awful, terribly outdated experience. Queues and a complete lack of speed at every turn, from initial check in, passing through security, waiting in line for immigration, then again through customs and final baggage checks prior to getting on the plane. Allocate 3-4 hours if you want a less stressful experience. KLIA + airline management, what do you actually do? Are you sleeping?",Negative
"Best Airport, but immigration is very slow.",Negative
Very limited dining restaurant inside KLIA 1 international departure hall.... not even comparable to thier neighbour countries airport,Negative
"The airport is very nice, but it's too far from the city and not well signposted, so it's easy to get lost. The staff is very friendly and helpful, but keep in mind that you have to leave well in advance, especially if there's traffic. There are many security measures inside, but if you want to buy something, you have to leave and go through security on the way back.",Negative
"The airport itself is pretty decent, but the helpline and hospitality staff could use some work. They weren’t very friendly or helpful. And most of the lounges don’t even serve alcohol, which is a bummer since Malaysia is a popular tourist destination.",Negative
"This was by far the worst and most unacceptable experience I’ve ever had with any airline. At the Batik Air baggage counter in Kuala Lumpur before flight OD171 to Denpasar, I was shouted at, threatened, and pressured into paying a baggage fee of 650 MYR, with the amount changing several times without explanation. First it was more, then less, then suddenly 650 – it was chaotic and clearly unprofessional.

The staff member at the baggage scale used aggressive language, raised their voice, and intimidated me in front of other passengers. I felt unsafe and coerced. This was not a normal excess baggage fee – it felt like extortion. I complied because I felt I had no choice.

This is absolutely not the standard I expect from any airline, especially not from Batik Air, which previously had my trust. I have filed a formal complaint with the airline and am awaiting a refund and investigation.

I strongly warn other travelers: If you’re flying from Kuala Lumpur with Batik Air, be cautious at the baggage counter. Keep records, film interactions, and don’t let yourself be bullied.",Negative
"I arrived at T2 on a late-night flight. I missed the last train and looked for Glab, but the sign said it was in a restricted area. It was raining, so I had no choice but to take a taxi. Glab was 78 ringgit, but the driver said he would take me to the hotel for 100, so I got in, but when we arrived, he wanted me to pay 100 dollars. I later looked online and found that there was a Glab stop nearby. Don't get into touted taxis, as they will scam you.",Negative
"This is Malaysia's largest airport and main gateway for overseas visitors to enter Malaysia. At peak times, be prepared to wait a very long time for your checked in luggage to come out. The aerotrain connecting the terminals is still out of order.",Negative
"The KLIA T2 airport is new, but design and service are not international standard. First of all: there are at least 4 checks after check in: first security check is to check your passport and boarding pass, then first (preliminary) baggage check. Then you go for normal immigration check. Don’t relax there as closer to your gate wing there is a proper security check. The wings are very very long, so is 8000 steps by the time of boarding. There not enough female toilet: queue in each of 2 in my wing were 20+ females. If you arrive to terminal 2 there is another issue, they don’t allow trolleys from the plane arrival gate to the exit from the airport, I had to change trolley twice: I e I used 3 trolleys. Immigration queue - 1 hour. There is no green and red corridor in customs, all luggage goes through screening. All shopping split in zones between all these 4 checks. Flying via KL is cheap but service is cheap too",Negative
"Quite a long distance to departure hall...
The only advantage is that KLIA2 offer free buggy services for elderly etc. But I didn't see any on the departure level...
There is still room for improvement...",Negative
checked in at terminal one and my gate is also at terminal one but I need to walk to G1 to take the shuttle bus to opposite of terminal one. Really not very convenient and confusing. Other than that it's an ok airport.,Negative
"17 Feb 2023. The airport is in dire straits. At the main terminal, all lounges are closed except for Malaysia airline lounge. Wifi can be connected but no internet connection. Dual flight sharing gates and when 1st flight is delayed, passenger for 2nd flight cannot check in the gate (see photo), Starbucks, Old town white coffee are crowded and full, e-scooter (service personnel) zipping around in the airport at high speed, insufficient seats at some area and passengers have to sit on the floor. Even Rolex shop is closed. Airport is at least 50mins away from KL/PJ! Hope this airport will be improved in my next trip.2nd photo

"Few seats/ places to sit/charge devices / activities for those transitioning to intl flights. Zero vegan food (only vegetarian options and most of them are not suitable for vegans, and the staff doesn’t understand what vegan is). At least they had plant milk for coffee but it’s expensive.

"The immigration customs was extremely slow, which proved that we had indeed arrived in Southeast Asia. This slow customs officer took an average of nearly five minutes to trouble each passenger. He was a bit arrogant, which was quite annoying.",Negative
"Terrible! The signage is confusing. I landed in Terminal 2 and had to take the shuttle over to Terminal 1. This was supposed to be the shuttle, but we stopped at the Long Term Parking Lot. That was where the driver decided to take a lunch break, so we stopped there for a while before moving on.",Negative
"The airport layout is very confusing. There are no clear signs, and it was extremely difficult to find the lounge. I don’t understand why there are so many checkpoints to go through. I arrived more than 3 hours early, but ended up spending only 40 minutes in the lounge before heading to the gate.",Negative

"The most important thing to people in this world right now is connectivity. To their phones, family & friends, social media, data and most importantly while traveling remote work.

This airport is beautiful and has a great process of getting through. The mall is mind blowing but all of that goes down the drain and significantly impacts your rating when while inside I can’t connect to the internet long enough to send an email because the server or signal is soooo bad. So I’m left with 2.5 hours of productivity because I cannot stay connected long enough to the Internet. And it’s for sure not me because my MacBook Air is brand new out of the box.

Fix it please….",Negative
"The only airport in the world i know, where you are not alloid to bring your refilable water to the gate. Security control is right at the gate and inside the small waiting room is no refil possible. Thats not sustainable. The only possibility is buying something at the shops",Negative
"Worst airport ever experienced! The attitude of Batik Air Malaysia staff and all the staff present at the airport were poor, unable to support passengers at all! Batik Air Malaysia staff had a bad attitude! They told passengers like this: “CLOSED! NONE OF MY BUSINESS” when passengers only had 1 hour to board the plane and refused to print the boarding pass for the passengers, and responded with the worst attitude possible!!",Negative
"Such a bad airport to leave via. Takes ages to get to some gates, multiple security checks and all the shops are before security so you can’t buy water for your flight. Soo much walking… Might be okay if you could rent a buggy but wouldn’t solve the water issue. Plus the restaurants are expensive.",Negative
The immigration process needs to improve immediately. It took me so long every time  I’ve visited. Approximately more than 1 hr.,Negative
"I had an extremely disappointing experience at Malaysia’s Airport Terminal 2. It was overcrowded with long lines, and the staff was not only unhelpful but also rude. One of the officers took my Dior and Chanel perfumes, which were under 100ml and purchased from duty-free, claiming they were not allowed. He kept them in his pocket without any proper explanation.

In addition, he confiscated all of my expensive purchases and seemed greedy and unprofessional, as though he had never seen such items before. He even pressured me by asking, “Do you want to catch your flight or not?” This made me feel very intimidated, especially since I was traveling alone.

Furthermore, although I was allowed 7kgs in check-in, the lady at the counter charged me approximately 130 RM for an extra weight charge, despite my prior allowance. I tried explaining the situation, but she ignored me.

I would not recommend anyone visit Malaysia based on this experience. The way they treat tourists is appalling, and I felt threatened and mistreated.

Shame on Malysians !",Negative
"The worst airport that I have ever visited in this 2025 from over 10airports. How that possible that flight landed at 9am but now 11am I still don’t pass through the immigration.

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight.

Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers. These include clearer directional signs and more readily available information.

Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member to go to C15 for a transfer to the arrival hall. The signage for this transfer was unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus. Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay. Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldn’t it be better to have basic international “standard” too?

The situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall. The area was extremely crowded,people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration.
Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic which leads to all these mess.
After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for. The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when everyone was looking for the right belt for their luggage. Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right.

We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the Singapore Airlines logo on the floor. Quite a handful of luggage was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight were still stuck in immigration. Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt.

Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage much of which was in Malay.
This can be rather challenging, especially after a series of such ""events"" we went through. We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter, who knows we must go through the same things going back.

On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall.
Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.We have to endure our thirst till our flight take off.

As a tourist, I don’t enjoy it if I have to go through so much hassle just to travel.
Who doesn’t want hassle-free travel?
For the sake of everyone, I hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.",Negative
"An sich echt schöner Flughafen, leider eher unübersichtlich. Ausm Flugzeug raus mussten wir erstmal, 20-25 min laufen + Bahn fahren um überhaupt an der Passkontrolle anzukommen. Dort angekommen ist alles ebenso sehr unübersichtlich, Schilder besagen Europäer können den automatisierten Vorgang nutzen, Beamte allerdings verweisen einen zum Schalter. Der Flughafen hat ca. 50 Schalter, aber nur 8 waren besetzt?! Nach einer halben Stunde waren wir dann auch dort fertig und haben unser Gepäck abgeholt.

"I have nothing good to say about Kuala Lumpur. Never recommend going through this airport. We had a 2 hour lay over coming back from Thailand to Perth.

I then asked 4 different security, workers at the airport for help even the ones that could speak English didn’t want to help us at all.almost laughed in our faces.  We walk around with tears for more than an hour trying to find where to go. Instead they sent us to the wrong area told us to go to y15. We then went there the air Asia staff worker without saying anything else told us “ your in the wrong place” nasty nasty people. We were there for longer than 8 hours trying to get another plane home. No compensation no help no nothing. $2600 aud they charged for 1 flight home to Perth Australia's. That is disgraceful. We spoke to a local at the airport and he told us to never come back he even hates his own country he mentioned you don’t want to get stuck here because you are at least 1 hour away from any resources. The people are miserable and rude. Never ever again. Singapore is the way to go. See attached photo of the air Asia staff who did not help us. You only have air Asia at that airport. You can’t book any other flying company’s.  Scams scams scams. Can I also mention this happened to 5 other groups on the same plane not just us. 5 other groups of family’s, friends missed the same flight. Not good enough AIR ASIA. Never flying with you again.

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling.  This looks fancy but very old school.
Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating

Very confusing direction or procedure given.
I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers
When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products.
Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate when leaving from KL to overseas. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority.

As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go.

Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there.

You continue to wait at the original boarding gate until the flight leaves from the changed boarding gate. Leaving you stranded.

It feels inefficient for each gate to have its own security checkpoint, and it was confusing on whether we were boarding or not.",Negative
"Honestly, if you are of African, Chinese, Philippines, Indian, Bengali, Nepalese, any south or south east Asian country think twice before boarding a plane to tour Malaysia or to transiting at Kula Lumpur airport. If you had a good time at this airport, great. If you didn't, avoid it in the future.

The officers that work here are nothing more than poor uneducated people given jobs because they are Muslim Malays. If you are travelling alone they will judge you based on your colour and ethnicity.

I have learnt that a lot of bullying and physical assualt are subjected to people of Bengali, Burmese, Nepalese or sub continent backgrounds. This was specifically from a foreign worker and have verified a lot of similar cases from trip advisor.

I had a friend who witnessed a group of 3-4 female Malaysian officers trying to steal the bag of an Indian girl of Aus/US/UK (can't tell the exact accent) nationality.

I have also seen people get shouted and others being hit! Like what the hell! I have never seen such uncivilised behaviour at an international airport, and I have been to numerous airports across Asia and the middle east.

A lot of Malaysian officers are also thieves. Be careful. I have heard of several incidents where they target individuals travelling alone, in pairs or in small groups getting pulled aside, physically hit and having money taken unlawfully from them.

Though I'm not surprised. It's a Muslim majority country. Usually these people tout about honesty and peace but actually are the polar opposite rude, violent and openly steal.

Like I said, if you are from an African, south or south east Asian background (note specifically not nationality but background) don't bother even going through the airport let alone holidaying here. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.",Negative

Dear traveler, do NOT use ""taxi"" that waiting at the airport. They ""offer"" you a ride for rm300-400. You should only get a ride via ehailing service, I recommended BOLT. A ride from airport to Kuala Lumpur should not exceed RM80, MAX. If a 4 seats it RM50 MAX. If you book an ehailing, driver can't ask more money from you. Pay what in the app. If driver ask for more money, record them & car number plate, and go to police station to submit a report. Those driver who doesn't use the app / ask for more money is the betrayal to Malaysia.",Negative
"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?!

First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. I’ve traveled through many large airports, but I’ve never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that… but what came next was even worse.

After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub.

We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (we’re used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle.

Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we weren’t allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, ""because it's too late now to buy tickets"" (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel.

In the end, we paid almost triple the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there.

And also, the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration! I had such a hard time to book the Grab taxi and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, in any airport that's when wifi is needed!! But here there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!!

I've never had this much hastle and wasted time to manage to exit an airport.

This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia. I've never thought an airport would affect my will to visit a country but here we are.",Negative

Upon arrival you are dropped off in the departure area and not in the arrival area, then you go out and go to check the arrival area, in order to pick up your luggage you need to complete a quest.

"Kalau punya rencana perjalanan ke malaysia lewat KLIA,.perhatikan waktu nya, kalau ada yg mendesak atau pindah pesawat usahakan beri waktu lebih minimal 2 jam karena proses custom nya sangat lama, bisa memakan waktu 1 jam untuk antri dan selesai pemeriksaan, counter petugas yg di buka untuk satu section hanya 2 saja n antrian nya panjang sekali...

Untuk proses check in juga jgn mepet, siapkan minimal 2 jam lbh awal karena sekali lg proses nya sangat lama.

"I’ve traveled through KLIA countless times, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading.

With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where it’s due- the new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well designed, good ventilation, clean and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail space—why so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradise—why isn’t KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign café chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti?

Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jean’s. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysia’s rich culinary diversity?- take a page out of Jakarta or Singapore airport.

To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (I’ve lost count how long I’ve waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an ‘Ask Me For Help’ staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone. Customer service should be better than this!

KLIA, let’s do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers.

P.S. if you’re ever at the Satellite building of KLIA terminal 1, I highly recommend checking out the Jungle Boardwalk 😄 I always look forward to visiting it if my Gate is located there. 🌴🌳🌴",Negative

"One of the worst airports I've ever been to.
The staff is incredibly nonchalant, more busy checking their phones than helping passengers in difficulty.

We arrived 30 minutes before boarding, but the agent at the counter categorically refused to let us through. He didn't even bother to call the gate to let us know we were there or try to find a solution.
I know you have to arrive 1 hour before check-in and 30 minutes before boarding, but this was truly exceptional.

Background: Our first flight (with Air Asia) was delayed by 1 hour, which left us only 45 minutes to check in for our second flight (with Malaysia Airlines). And in those 45 minutes, we had to: exit immigration, fill out immigration paperwork, take a taxi (because the train between the terminals was closed), go through customs again in the other terminal, and then take another bus to get to the plane, which is impossible to do in 45 minutes.

Changing terminals was a real nightmare: the train connecting the terminals was out of service, so we had to retrace our steps to catch a taxi, which we had to pay for ourselves at a reception desk—where, once again, the staff seemed more engrossed in their phones than in their work.

After the first agent refused, we tried our luck at another check-in kiosk (using a machine); other people were there. We explained the situation, and to get through, we had to lie by saying that ""the man at the counter had given us the green light."" At that point, we were let through. Immigration and customs literally told us to run!

But when we arrived at the boarding gate, just a minute before departure, they categorically refused to let us board. The staff were there, on their phones, with no desire to help. One woman even pretended to call someone to tell us that ""it's over, the doors are closed,"" before literally turning her back on us.

All this because of a delay by one of their partner airlines, and there was no flexibility, no consideration.

The result: we had to buy new tickets, this time with Emirates. And there, however, nothing to complain about—top-notch welcome, professional service.",Negative

Wi-Fi connectivity is slow, and there are limited food and retail options. A significant upgrade or expansion is needed if the airport aims to keep up with other regional hubs.

Additionally, the transport pick-up experience at Terminal 2 was a nightmare. The poorly designed two-lane pick-up area created severe congestion, and we ended up waiting over an hour just to be picked up.

The first queue leads to 10 counters! The other queue only 2 counters! And I am in that line we couldn't see when we came because a lot of people, only realized when we're infront. No wonder our line is so slow and the other so fast. The staff should've seen and fixed it! The immigration staff is very slow too. It took 1 minute 30 second for 1 person to go through! In australia it only took 15 seconds! We came 3 hours early to enjoy the lounge. But just from luggage dropping to immigration it took us 1 hour and 30 minutes! My back hurts from standing too long.

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines.

While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight.

Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers.

- These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information.

Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member..standing at the side, to go to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall.

- Wouldn't it be better to put up clear large signage at both sides of the walkway while  we disembarked?

- Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay.

The signage for this bus transfer was also unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus.

Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldn’t it be better to have a basic international “standard” too?
Not sure if the timing we arrived is a peak season but that day itself,the no.of passengers is not a joke.
The situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall.
The area was extremely crowded, and people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration.
Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to manage the human traffic, which leads to all these mess.
Good thing is the officer trying their level best to clear the queue.

After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was another challenge.
The area was so crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you are required to walk near the belt to check on the monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for.

The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when there are different groups of people surrounding the area....some was like lost souls looking for directions,  while some gather in between the way waiting for their friends, and you have those looking up and low for the right belt for their luggage.

We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the SQ Airlines logo on the floor.

There was quite a handful of luggage that was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight as us were still stuck in immigration.

Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt....

This can be rather challenging, especially after coming a long ""way"" out from immigration 😑

Thought we are only required to transit to the arrival hall as a 1 time off thingy.

Who knows, we must go through the same things even for departure.

On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall.

Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.

We have to endure our thirst till our flight takes off.

As a tourist, the airport gives the 1st impression for passengers and how they are organized.

Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.",Negative
It's a big airport with lots of amenities and shopping options. Food is limited to asian food. Very few veggie options. I did not find Indian cuisine anywhere.

So many more hurdles to jump such as filling in an MDAC, yes, we were asked to fill it in on-line at Siem Reap, but thought it couldn't possibly be for us as so many 'mandatory' boxes were irrelevant to us. However, at the airport, they insisted we filled it in with a bunch of false information, i.e. the address where we would be staying (had to put in an address that they provided.. which was the airport's address) a waste of time, as we felt we could miss our connecting flight. We also had to create our own baggage tags, then TWO separate baggage screenings - so unnecessary. There are so many options of queues without clear instructions, so many people, so much walking - it just seemed chaotic. It's not my favourite airport.

Firstly, the staff were generally unfriendly and appeared to have minimal understanding of English, which made basic communication difficult to impossible.
More critically, there was a noticeable general incompetence across various functions. Staff seemed unable or unwilling to perform their duties, such as overseeing passengers and maintaining order in the queues. An additional major point of inefficiency was the self-service process: I was directed to the scanner by immigration staff, only for the scanner to then instruct me to return to the immigration counter, causing further unnecessary delays and frustration.
I repeatedly observed an absolute lack of professional supervision, where people were simply allowed to cut in line or where queues dissolved into chaos without any staff intervention.
This combination of poor (and by times even disrespectful) customer service, language barriers, and failure to enforce basic operational procedures led to unnecessary stress and delays. It's clear that KLIA urgently needs to invest in significantly better training for its personnel, focusing on customer service, language proficiency, and core job efficiency.

If I could give 0 stars, I would!",Negative

"Poorest airport of world; doesn't have anything and amenities. Not proper lounge.
They have lounge outside security check🤦, then they don't have any charging point at any location. They made one or two location but only two person can put two things on charge. After the security check there's one more security check on gates starts. Seating area opens only around 1 hour before the boarding, before than They keep close; They made trolley but it's not allowed in escalators. Washroom located in east and west and north and south so far with 4-5 person(max to max) can use.",Negative
"I recently traveled to Malaysia with my family, including young children, and was extremely disappointed by the poor management at the airport upon our arrival.

After our plane landed, we had to wait for two full hours just to get through immigration. The lines were incredibly long, and there were no clear directions, very few staff members to assist, and an overall lack of organization in managing the arriving passengers. My children and elderly family members were forced to stand the entire time, which was both exhausting and unacceptable after a long flight.

I expected better from a major international airport. There was no prioritization for families with children, no proper communication, and very little effort to speed up the process. It felt like the airport was completely unprepared to handle the volume of passengers arriving.

My advice to the airport management: Please improve the arrival process by increasing staff at immigration counters, organizing separate queues for families, and providing clearer signage and communication. Travelers come to Malaysia expecting hospitality and efficiency — unfortunately, this experience was neither welcoming nor efficient.

I hope my feedback will be taken seriously to ensure a better experience for future visitors.",Negative
"While leaving Kuala Lumpur Airport in Malaysia, the scary robber called the Malaysian police and checked my passport, searched me, took my $1200 and 5500 ringgit, said he would take me to the office, and took me to the stairs. When I asked for my ringgit back, he beat me, kept 900 ringgit and returned all the ringgit and dollars. I was in a panic and a terrible state. I have been to three or four countries before, this has not happened. What kind of danger did I experience when I came here for three days?",Negative
"The nation's pride and joy needs to be updated. It is looking really dated and tired compared to other international airports. There is very limited vibrance as compared to the rest.

Aerotrain is still out of order. Taking busses to the satellite building is like aged old way of moving in the airport. First and business class passengers have a separate bus which has larger and lesser seats. However, the exhaust is still an issue. Only MAS passengers get the i5 via the same place. Service however is good. The bus is at the G gates and there is a personnel who chaperones passenger to the busses. There are also coffee machines and comfy sofas at the bus area. Don't quite understand rationale for this as who ever that is already there will very likely want to get to the satellite building lounges quickly. Hence, no one can be seen there save and except for staff.",Negative
"The local flight delayed by 3 hours and as compensation they provided meal, that too non veg. What about international traveller's who are pure vegeterian, nothing. Once you reach the gates there are no proper food options and then you keep everyone waiting for 3 hours. On top of that there was a gate change too and additional inconvenience.",Negative
Beautiful airport but everything is far apart and directional signage is not clear. I accidentally left my small bag at one of the many security checks (3 security checks with Xrays after arrival??

What's so unacceptable is the questions are basic form to fill that could have been registered in the desk with additional unnecessary info. Then you stand again in line for the passport control. Everyone seemed lost and there was no help at all from airport personnel, I wonder how terrible this is for old people or those who can't connect to the internet. Not the best start for tourism in Malaysia, let alone the additional charges added by the government for tourism.",Negative
"Inconvenient airport:
1. there are no normal places to rest in the hall before going through passport control,
2. there is only one place where you can drink water for free (or rather, I found only one) and this water machine still needs to be found, there are no signs for it.
3. Incomprehensible navigation.",Negative
"I must say is chaos, I was queuing at the counter and you see passengers jumping queue with the blessings of air Asia staff because she say their flight is going to depart. The best part the four passengers take up so much time and arguing with the check in staff that I don't think they are in a hurry. There is another four European passengers behind me keep jumping and cursing at the queue jumper. They scold the air Asia staff that that is the worst airport that they fly and the staff told him thank you. That make things worse and he got more annoyed. I am wordless.",Negative

With all due respect, i know that air asia is a budget airliners, and i'm well aware that i cannot ask much for a terminal that serve low cost carrier.

Queuing line becomes very-very long, check in can be done with automated machine, however many of the passengers are confused and cannot do it properly. Imigrations are done manually, no automated gate for foreigners.

Water dispenser also almost all-empty, while walking to my gate, i came across about 4-5 water dispenser, and wished to refill my bottle, however all of it were empty.",Negative

I want to give zero star to this airport. My brother and his friends wanted to visit Malaysia. He booked a trip for 4 days with his friends. They had confirmed ticket for a round trip. The custom held their passports and are holding them at the airport and not giving them an entry. It’s been 2 days and they have been sitting at the airport. The people working at the airport are fraud and demanding $100 from travelers. The police are holding on to every traveler passport. People are traveling from other countries and the police is demanding money and sending people back to their countries. If they are recording the police at the airport is checking their phones and deleting their videos. I am leaving a review so more people can be aware of the fraud that is happening at this airport. Please don’t travel to Malaysia. They are fraud. Not a country for travelers. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS COUNTRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Negative

Airport positively. The transport from the GRAB application was very poor. It did not reach us. Regular taxi to the center 117zl almost 56km from the airport near Petronas,Negative
"The organization is good, in departure mode, although there are few travelers. However, it's dirty and somewhat rundown.
The restrooms are okay. Lack of modernity compared to the modernism displayed in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
Needs interior design.
I didn't expect it to be like Singapore airport, but better nonetheless.

In arrival mode, it's indeed confusing 🤷‍♀️ where's the luggage??? And if you're arriving from a two-hour flight and have a jet lag, it's very complicated.
Nothing or very little is written.

The taxis are all waiting to take you and charge you €30 to get to the center; I'm surprised they pay that much.

While walking through the airport, the shuttle bus honked several times, which was extremely unpleasant. If you're traveling with young children, they'll definitely be frightened and cry.",Negative
Rude staff during the security check. The airport should properly train courtesy to the security staff before scolding people. Worst experience for an international airport ever. Will avoid this airport again in the future.,Negative
"The worst airport I've ever had. We were flying out of gate L and it was a nightmare. The air conditioning in the entire wing is practically non-functional - it's so hot, people aren't allowed into the waiting rooms at the gates behind the glass, they're empty. Everyone ends up sitting in the hallway and even on the floor because there aren't enough seats. You have to stand in line for half an hour to get to the women's restroom, and you end up in a stall with a hole in the floor and all covered in water. It's very surprising that such a progressive city has such a disgusting airport.",Negative

"I don't know if T1 is better, but flew off from T2 and the system really needs more work and thinking through.

Starting from the immigration gates, we were all directed to use the e-gates. There were Chinese tourists who were stuck, and they couldn't understand the error message that was in English. But there was not a single staff present? How can such gates be left unattended?
All other tourists behind were left stranded.

After the e-gates, our bags were scanned. So we emptied out all our water.

In the departure hall we spotted water coolers so we refilled our bottles.

As we were walking to the gate, there was suddenly another security screening?? And so we had to empty our bottles again??

Guess what, the water coolers at the boarding gate were not working.

Passengers at T2 are on budget flights with no beverages. We needed the water.

Also, the whole airport smelt of vomit and pee.

I don't think KLIA is anywhere near calling themselves an internationally recognized airport. Not by a long shot. If someone from KLIA is reading this, please take this feedback seriously to improve your airport.",Negative
"Der langsamsten verplanteste Flughafen, wo wir jemals waren.
Legen jemals ihre Regeln anders aus.
Du kaufst Getränke und musst sie dann am Gate wegschütten, genauso eine Kinderschere wegschmeißen die davor durch 7 Flüge auf dieser Reise ok war.
Das Personal war auch extrem unfreundlich vor allem bei der Immigration und dem Security Check. Leider das komplette Gegenteil zu Singapur.",Negative
"It's still a great airport that meet the customers demand, but there are some run down facility and hardware, such as aged carpet with visible discoloration at the arrival hall, and some run down toilets with dim lamps.

However the immigration section has been improved to cater the huge crowd of tourists. That's a good thing. Nevertheless, the custom checkpoint no longer provide the green zone for people with light luggages to walk thru. Everyone has to queue up to pass thru the custom checkpoint, where the officers will randomly pick any large luggage to scan for taxable items. So, be prepared for that.

By the way, the departure hall do not have any water dispenser for you to refill your water bottle. You have to buy water with a sealed plastic bag (the bag is not free), in order to take it into the waiting hall. This is allowed by security check at the waiting hall.

The new aerotrain ride between the satellite building and main building was good. Albeit it is a new train, there were a few events of disruption due to technical glitch (via news portals), so be prepared to take the buses again.",Negative
"Check-in takes ages, every passenger seems to be a problem. To get to the C4 gate, you need to take a bus (and you must hurry, because check-in takes ages), and then right before the gate there is a security check. If you have water in a reusable bottle, you have to go to the bathroom to pour it out. And it’s actually a good idea to go to the bathroom before the security check, because after you’re in the gate waiting area, there is no bathroom.
Worst experience ever.",Negative

"Airport staff are really the worst here. All eligible countries that are allowed to use the e-gate were forced to use the immigration line, but there are very few staff at the immigration line to manage it. On top of that, when going to the nearest immigration counter the staff was rude and said ""this one is only for business class"" even though the line was empty. So you ultimately have counters that are over capacity cause they have implemented a e-gate system that doesn't work and a set of counters that have staff and no users cause they don't have the right ""boarding pass"". Airport itself is okay, but the operations are a disgrace to such a beautiful city. KLIA Do better. For anyone flying through, ensure you take extra time in case the airport is busy and systems are not working as expected.",Negative
so god damn disorganised,Negative
Terrible management,Negative
"Had one of the worst experiences at KLIA . There are absolutely no restaurants while waiting for your flight. Also, the security check people have some weird rule of not carrying liquids more than 100 ml/gm as cabin baggage. Half the things which they sell in the lounge  are more than 250 gm/ml. Very badly run airport.",Negative
"Feels average for an International airport. Certain areas looked run down, like the Eraman shops on the way to the gates, the baggage inspection section before the gates. The lighting at most area are quite dim, some not working ,and flooring looks bad ( chipping , and many reworked areas). On the good side, the staff is effecient with the large crowds.",Negative

I've flown through other airports with tighter connections and the organisation of the arrival to departure gates was better considered and not nearly as stressful.",Negative
"I love Malaysia, but the experience with the immigration department at KLIA1 was very disappointing. The staff were unnecessarily rude both on arrival and departure. It left a bad impression and needs urgent improvement. Malaysia is a beautiful country, and I sincerely hope this can be addressed to make the entry and exit experience more welcoming.",Negative

The worst transfer ever, is it so difficult to write signs ? Is it so expensive to let people know where they are?",Negative

"Everywhere long waiting times, including two separate security checks one at the gate, train ride, making it very stressful. Not well managed. Very few toilets. Even though I came very early I barely made the door and had to drop all liquids as the security check is done at the door and there is nowhere to poor the water, you have to walk back to far away toilet. Not a good experience in general",Negative
"On June 16th, around 4pm: when I first landed on imagination gate, the passport checkers seemed don't know what to do their job. They asked us to go to this or that officer to check the passports.

Oh, one more thing, I did say thank you wth a smiley face 😊 after they handed me the passport but they be like 🗿",Negative

Certainly this bin is for illustration purpose only.",Negative
"Extremely rude and unprofessional immigration staff with a terrible attitude.
This is many tourists first impression and first point of contact with the people of the country they’re entering, and it is not ideal to be treated in such a manner here.
Make sure you have all your documents in line is all I can say, and if you’re traveling together be prepared to be yelled at to go to separate desks each.
What is the point of the mandatory digital arrival card when they ask you every single question 20 times again and ask for proof?
Had a great time in Malaysia otherwise but this certainly ruined our first impressions. Makes you less likely to visit again having to deal with this

On a side note - Beware of the scammy airport workers by bag claims from who I literally had to pull my own luggage away from because he wanted to scam me by 'helping' and undoubtedly asking for payment at the end. How the hell does management allow such people to work at the airport?",Negative
Painful experience using the computers to do a pre authorisation for entry! No people around to help you and you have to do it unless you did it already before you arrived!!,Negative
"Such a beautiful country let down by such slow immigration, both arriving and departing. Each time the desks were only half staffed.

When leaving KL I'd suggest you arrive at airport at least 3hrs+ before leaving. The queue to get through immigration took over an hour!

"Super long Immigration lines with about 400 people in total and yet the immigration officers just log off, close the gate and go away for an hour randomly leaving only 2 officers to complete immigration.

No regard for fasting Muslims standing in excruciating lines with 10 kg weights on their backs while Muslim immigration officers take frequent breaks.

Shame on Malaysian government for allowing this behaviour.",Negative
"Ridiculous security arrangements at the airport. When going through departure security it is a meaningless scan, with no checks on person or water etc. this means that if you buy any liquids in the duty free section, you cannot take them on the plane without a label - which is not offered in the shops automatically. This means that you have to leave any liquids you just bought. Ridiculous. Bags must be offered straight away.",Negative
"Terminal 1 of KLIA is very disappointing. Being a rapidly growing global destination Kuala Lumpur deserves a far better airport. kLIA T1 lacks the glitter and glamour flaunted by other major airports. The immigration and baggage claim areas lacked room and felt claustrophobic, especially considering the volume of passengers handled by the airport. Neither the airport has any attention grabbing design language to it

Navigating within the airport was a bit tricky at the outset. Taxi pickup points are easy to identify and communicate

Overall the experience was just average. Again, KL deserves a far better airport",Negative
Very inefficient baggage handling. Received luggages only 1.5 hours after landing. Terrible quality of service compared to other international airports,Negative
The worst airport ever. Got hours early for flight check-in with an insane long queue. Then the immigration queue which is so ridiculously long with only few counters available. Finally the customs check queue. Total of 3+hours of waiting in those long queues. Noticed some people missed their flights and staffs not helping to give an express queue for those near-miss flights. I have seen lots of queues in other airports but not as slow as this.,Negative
Longest immigration process ever. Be prepared to wait over an hour since they only have one operator per line and their signage is not straight forward.,Negative
Worst airport in the whole world. Before boarding the flight you are forced to bin your water and there's no way to refill it. You'll have to rely on the airplane to provide you water throughout the flight. Why can't they hire smarter people to manage this place? The train has been out of order for years. Don't deserve any salary.,Negative
"Worst airport I’ve ever been at. When I landed I stood in line for 1,5 hours at immigration!! Landed in terminal 2 and my next flight was from terminal 1, the shuttle bus took 20-30 minutes. After I checked in for my next line I had to stand another hour  to get thru immigration??? I almost missed my flight, my layover was 3,5-4 hours and I still had to run to the plane when it was boarding!! People working at the airport are not helpful. Very ineffective airport!!

"We recently traveled from Malaysia to Cochin via KLIA with AirAsia, and unfortunately, the experience with the ground staff was very disappointing. We wanted to check in our baggage directly at the counter instead of using the kiosk, and when we asked the staff about it, their response was rude and unhelpful. They just told us to either use the kiosk or pay cash and try another counter, with no intention to assist further.

At the “V” counter, a staff member initially told us to join the queue. But when we reached the front, the person issuing boarding passes and bag tags questioned how we got there and rudely told us to go back. Even when we explained that another AirAsia staff member had asked us to wait in line, she denied it outright, saying no one from their team would do that.

There was a serious lack of coordination, professionalism, and courtesy from the ground staff. It left a very bad impression on us. AirAsia should really consider training their ground staff better, especially when handling international travelers who expect basic respect and guidance.",Negative

The luggage won’t pecah if drop or what? Then that abang answered：”if pecah then pecah lah”

wow? What kind of service attitude is this? RM60 for one layer of bubble wrap and one plastic bag? I would rather do it at home myself if I knew it end up like this. Some more it’s free if I do it at home.

"KLIA1 Renovation: A Step Forward, But Where’s the Local Charm?

I’ve traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading.

With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where it’s due—the new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well-designed, clean, and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail space—why so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradise—why isn’t KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign café chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti?

Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jean’s. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysia’s rich culinary diversity?

To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (I’ve lost count how long I’ve waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an ‘Ask Me For Help’ staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone. Customer service should be better than this!

KLIA, let’s do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers.",Negative
"Train faulty. Toilet faulty (can’t flush), no water dispenser at boarding gates - might be a Malaysian way of telling you to purchase drinks.

"One of the worst airports I have ever been to. I had a flight on 24th August, 2025 from KUL to Chennai at 9.30PM. I went to the airport by 5PM and completed my check-in by 5.30PM. I then went to immigration and it took hours and hours to complete the immigration. There were 3 queues and only 2 officers per queue working at their own pace. The line kept on getting bigger and bigger as the time passed, but still the immigration officers didn’t show any responsibility in helping us fast track the process. I was literally waiting for more than 4 hours in line and even after requesting them multiple times about my flight timings they simply told “This is how it is and if you are late you will miss the flight.”

It’s really a very poor management by Malaysian airport and I feel it’s something really serious which they need to address. If the queue is high, please manage it in such a way to add more officers in duty to avoid the commotion.",Negative

Actually this is a well designed hotel. But maintenance is bad ie the toilet is dirty, stinks and not well maintained, general surrounding area cleanliness can be improved too and is getting bad to worst.

Come on. MAHB can you guys do something about this as KLIA is one of the key entry point for visitors don't you guys take pride in what you do?. The lifts at the parking area is poorly maintained and dirty.

Check out the outside arrival lane, you have cones all over and it's poorly lited (spelling?).

"The airport is modern, spacious, and generally well-run. However, there were a few moments of confusion worth mentioning.

Upon arrival, the immigration process was not clearly marked. Passengers with Malaysian passports go through a different gate than those with foreign passports, but the signage didn’t make that obvious. Additionally, all international visitors must fill out a digital arrival form about their stay. There were enough computers available to do this at the airport, but the form isn’t very intuitive, and it requires knowing the exact address of your accommodation. It could definitely be made more user-friendly.

The departure experience was  quick, smooth, and without queues. However, just before boarding the plane, there was a second bag check, and surprisingly, you couldn’t bring any drinks on board — not even those in your own bottles or purchased in the terminal. Only drinks sealed in security bags by the shop were allowed, and not all stores offer this option. Unfortunately, no one informed
us of this at the time of purchase, which was frustrating and once again showed a lack of clear communication.",Negative
"This airport is quite impressive, but the distance to the next gate is really far, and I ended up pretty tired from walking. The international departure lounge is really small, disorganized, and lacks proper management.

The toilet maintenance is poor, and the cleanliness is not well-kept. Also, there are very few seats in the corridor before entering the waiting area, so a lot of people have to sit on the floor, almost like a refugee camp.

There are very few water dispensers and phone charging stations, and people have to wait in line just to charge their phones.

The immigration staff is unfriendly and treats passengers rudely. Overall, it was a pretty disappointing experience at this airport.",Negative
"I don't know if it's under the responsibility of AirAsia or the airport management, but I traveled in a lot of countries (poor or not), and I never seen such poor airport management. 1. They let people outside the boarding room, with no seats, until 1h before plane take off. There was mother with kids sitting on the ground. My plane only open the waiting seats 40 minutes before the departure. Not a single country airport I've been (59 countries so far) do that. And when I tried to suggest politely to the worker there to tell her manager to improve the system, so old people and pregnant women can get the seat in advance, the security guy came to ask what was my passport (as a sign of threat - yet smoothly)
2. The positions of the seat are ridiculous (check picture), with no space for the legs at all.
3. There is 2 security check before boarding (better than Egypt on that point)

I won't describe here the mess between delayed plane and change of gate (see screenshot) that would be way too long. I will also not describe the fact that I queued 3 times to be able to print my boarding pass with AirAsia(print your boarding pass before coming and avoid human interaction at all cost)",Negative

"My second trip through Kuala Lumpur International Airport was unfortunately just as frustrating as the first.

The customer service here is a huge problem. I asked multiple staff members for help with basic info, and every single one just shrugged, said ""I don't know"" and acted like it wasn't their job. There was zero effort to even try and find out. It's truly baffling.

Then there's the internal airport bus with no proper monitoring. We had our 5-month-old with us and we literally had to stand for a 5-minute ride between gates. The bus wasn't even packed but everyone was too busy hogging their spot to offer one up to someone struggling with a baby. The fear of losing balance and dropping our infant was terrifying. People just sat there watching us, completely uncaring.

To top it off, we saw a couple of electric buggies nearby, clearly for passenger assistance, but there was no one to drive them! We asked four different staff if they could help us get one, and each time, we got the same clueless ""I don't know"" response.

For an international airport, the lack of basic help and common courtesy is really poor. Traveling with a baby is already tough enough, and KLIA just made it worse. I'll definitely be trying to avoid this airport next time.",Negative

Make sure to exchange currency in advance if you need to buy anything; US dollars might work at some counters, but it's better to have Malaysian Ringgit. The waiting areas are basic, mostly just chairs no proper couches if you’re trying to relax during a layover.

"I was assaulted by a female airport customer experience officer who attempted to physically restrain me without justification. When I demanded to file a police report, I was told I would have to go to Terminal 2—something my Australian emergency passport did not permit. Despite my repeated requests, the airport police refused to take my report and instead escorted me to the immigration department.

There, I was met by an aggressive and unprofessional immigration officer named Kamarudin. When I asked for his full name in writing, he refused and rudely pointed to his name badge, telling me to take a photo with my phone. The moment I did, he became enraged and began intimidating me—even going so far as to take photos of me and my passport on his personal phone.

The girl was checking us in for the flight Kuala Lumpur - Bali
2.03.2025
AK 374
Departure at 18.20

At the check-in desk my husband asked for a seat next to us as usual.
To which we were told - only for an additional pay❗️

But we arrived 2 hours before the flight, the plane can not be full.
She told - «No, you have to pay extra to sit together!»

We refused on principle because it is always possible. We have been flying Air Asia for 8 years. And always! ALWAYS we were seated together.

The airport lady gave us seats at different ends of the plane as a matter of principle 34B and 6A

When I got on the plane, I found myself sitting with two men.
And my husband was at the other end of the plane with one woman and a free seat next to him.

So there was at least a possibility that I could have been seated next to my husband. But for some reason, your employee decided to do this to our family.
I could not sit with two strange men at the other end of the plane from my husband for family and religious reasons.

I independently reseated myself and was able to be next to my husband for the entire flight because the seat next to him was FREE!!!!!
And there was also plenty of free space on the airplane.

The girl herself was wearing a headscarf, she is a Muslim. And I think she understood perfectly well how to act so that we would not be pleasant. I don't understand why she would do that.

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was nothing short of frustrating.

The immigration officers are rude and disrespectful, making an already stressful experience far worse. To be honest, it felt like the staff were completely uninterested in their job, and some even seemed to resent being there.

In Malaysia, government jobs, including those at airports prioritize ethnic Malays over Indian and Chinese Malays. As a result, some government positions, such as immigration officers or airport staff, may be filled based on ethnicity rather than merit or qualifications. Due to this, individuals in these roles might lack the necessary qualifications or passion for the job, which can sometimes be reflected in their job performance and attitude.

What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: “We hope you’ve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality.” Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered.

Given this experience, I will never fly with Malaysian Airlines or visit Malaysia again and I certainly won't be encouraging my friends or family to visit. Avoid countries that do not respect and appreciate tourist coming to help their economy!",Negative

We arrived as a family with kids (8 months, 3, 7, and 9 years old). The “family/elderly” lane was a joke — the officer let some families with older kids go through, but told us only our 1 years baby can enter with his mother and the rest should go another Lane. When I asked why, he completely ignored me. It felt discriminatory and unprofessional.

Immigration was a nightmare: 75 minutes in line just for slow biometric checks, while our luggage was left unattended off the belt. On the return back home, an immigration officer told us our family was “too big” and refused to process all six passports, forcing us to split up. I have never seen such behavior in any international airport. Most Immigration officers were too rude.

To make things worse: Batik Air check-in staff were rude and lied about baggage weight, and duty-free prices were ridiculously overpriced (almost 3x more than outside).

I already told the imbecile staff that it's no need to do that. He tried to scanned it again and the light go red (stated already board). Even though he already do something wrong, he did the same mistake to my son behind me. What a waste a time and energy. Imbecile.",Negative

Having the water facilities when travelling is a real fundamental, to deny this basic is generally flawed! What an awful way to travel! 🤌🏼💧

Furthermore, the whole airport experience had excessive dependency on glitchy slow machines, which was tedious and frustrating. Scanning of tags for check in bags and boarding passes. Just creating unnecessary additional waiting times when you have to do a number of custom checks, immigration and departure security already in the first place.

There needs to be ways to minimise waiting times, user experience needs to be simpler and the processes to be streamlined.",Negative
Understaffed passport control,Negative

"My domestic flight was delayed and was at the wrong terminal, I was told at the information centre! to take a taxi from Terminal 2 to 1 because that was fastest. I later found out that the train took 3 minutes and cost 15x less than the taxi, and because I missed check in by 5 minutes the greedy people at the info desk who sent me to the taxi woman sitting next to him made me miss my international flight.

"Unfortunately, my experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was disappointing. Here are a few points that struck me negatively:
1. Strict baggage control, but not consistent:
My hand luggage was accurately weighed, and even though it was only slightly over 6kg, I was told to pay extra. At the same time, the Malaysian woman in front of me, weighing almost 8 kg, was allowed to walk away - that felt unfair.
2. Poor Signage:
Some gates had no numbers, which was extremely confusing. It was difficult to find the right path.
3. Lack of seating:
There were no seats at the gate, which made the wait unnecessarily tiring.
4. Inadequate Toilets:
The women's restrooms were a mess - I waited in line for over 30 minutes and when it was finally my turn, they were dirty. The men apparently had enough toilets as there were no queues.

Unfortunately, the airport was the worst I've ever been to.",Negative

"Horrible, just horrible!! The worst experience in my life, and I've been to many airports.
Automation of everything is disgusting!
Figure out for yourself why you can't go through the passport to go out into the city.
Figure out for yourself the form to fill out. (Like a visa on arrival)
Do the check-in yourself. (What if the phone is dead?) Although in my case there were problems with access to the Internet, also take this into account!
Check in your luggage yourself.
And if there is a problem, then figure out for yourself which line to stand in this time, and all the employees don't give a damn, even if you are seeing such automation for the first time!!

We wanted to stand in line to see a real person first, but the road was blocked by a tape and people were not allowed in, although the registration was still ongoing :/
Now I am sitting in this ""wonderful"" airport and I hope that I did everything right and my luggage will not fly off to where it should not
And for some reason another check before the gate, strange.
It was terminal 2, we will never get a visa run here again

The only plus is the cleanliness of the airport and fast customs control

My advice to everyone who has not seen such automation ""do it yourself"" is to come for at least 3 hours, it's brutal",Negative
"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines.

While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight.

Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers.

- These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information.

Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member..standing at the side, to go to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall.

Rather than having a staff member saying  out to those passengers embarking, there might be a chance people will miss that important message.

- Wouldn't it be better to put up clear large signage at both sides of the walkway while  we disembarked?

- Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay.

The signage for this bus transfer was also unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus.

Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldn’t it be better to have a basic international “standard” too?

The situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall.
The area was extremely crowded, and people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration.
Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic, which leads to all these mess.

After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging.
The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for.

The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when there are different groups of people surrounding the area....some was like lost souls looking for directions,  while some gather in between the way waiting for their friends, and you have those looking up and low for the right belt for their luggage.

Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right.

We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the SQ Airlines logo on the floor.

There was quite a handful of luggage that was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight as us were still stuck in immigration.

Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt....

Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage, much of which was in Malay.

This can be rather challenging, especially after coming a long ""way"" out from immigration 😑

We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter.

Who knows, we must go through the same things going back.

On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall.

Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.

We have to endure our thirst till our flight takes off.

As a tourist, the airport gives the 1st impression for passengers and how they are organized.

This wasn't the kind of experience I was expecting from KLIA.

Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.",Negative
Aircon is not working in departure hall but working along the corridor to the toilet. Weird the departure lounge level 3 aircon is not working where all restaurant located. Corridor towards the gate is cramp when flight is delay. Restaurant mix are good,Negative
Budget extra time for departure immigration. Queues were crazy.,Negative
"We flew with batik air. Check-in and the security checkpoint took minutes. Be aware that batik air seems to weigh your carry-on before boarding, and some people were stopped presumably to pay extra money for going over the maximum weight.

Interestingly enough, even though we also went over our limit, they let us pass without paying.

It feels inefficient for each gate to have its own security checkpoint, and it was confusing on whether we were boarding or not.",Negative
"The most unhelpful staff I’ve ever encountered. KLIA2 staff are more friendly. I lost my documents in customs and no one helped at all. They kept blaming me saying u forgot it at immigration, although I told them it must be in the scanning area.

Asked me to go all the way back to immigration carrying all my heavy bags.  I went all the way to immigration to look for it myself, they didn’t make any effort to call or find out anything.

Went all the way and then finally they called saying they found my passport somewhere, exactly where I said it was - they just didn’t want to check before. no apology at all and just asking where’s my location. No sympathy, rude tone - as if they didn’t tell me I had to go all the way to immigration to get my document.

Terrible way of acting and talking to customers, no sympathy at all. Staff needs training to talk to customers who are already distressed. They shouldn’t work in this industry",Negative

"I recently traveled through KLIA and was quite disappointed with the overall experience. The ground staff were uncooperative and extremely slow – it took me 45 minutes just to drop my luggage, which is unacceptable for a major international airport. There was a clear lack of urgency and coordination among the staff, which caused unnecessary delays and frustration.

The immigration process was no better. Officers were more engaged in chatting among themselves than assisting travelers. When it came to the facial recognition scan, there was no clear instruction on when to stop looking into the camera, leading to confusion and further hold-ups. Such negligence and poor communication from immigration staff are not what you'd expect from a facility that aims to be a gateway to the country.

Overall, KLIA seriously needs to step up its service standards. Staff training, efficiency, and customer interaction must be improved if the airport wants to compete with other major international hubs. I hope the management takes these issues seriously and implements changes soon.",Negative

"Not a pleasant experience. The satellite train is only available for first and business class.

"People who are at safety check in front of gate C4&C2  are not polite, not responsible.
I went through the safety check. A few people were standing there chatting, laughing. No one helping moving stuff like other airports. Then after I passed and sat down. A woman came over asking us - a few people were here waiting - where we were going. Then told us “out”, “wait outside”. No sorry, no explanation, and the attitude was not good .
They didn’t check or ask before you went through the safety check. After you’ve done everything - empty water bottles, take off the shoes… - eventually went through, then kicking you out. You have to do that again later.
I have traveled a lot, been to many airports. These people here are the worst I have ever seen. Lazy and irresponsible people!",Negative

There was a lady asking me a question from over 3 metres away and she was so soft spoken, I was also near the bag check line (sounds of the trays bashing down, people talk and zipping their bags, the roller conveyor belt). I gave her a puzzled look as I didn't hear her and she shouted the question at me and gave me an attitude (rolled her eyes). I genuinely did not hear her, this problem happened again with her voice later as she was announcing who could go on the plane and we were sitting near the door to exit (think again 3 metres away) and we could hardly hear her so people who were sitting all the way down the end if the waiting area were lining up randomly and she was getting annoyed at them for coming up when it wasn't their turn.

"I've been to many airports, but this one is one of the worst.

Poor Wi-Fi.

I've seen cockroaches in the bathroom, and it's always wet. It always smells.

The airport itself is large, but the gate area is cramped, making waiting around tiresome, especially in Terminal 2.

The hassle of having to go through immigration to transfer between terminals is also a hassle.

In Southeast Asia, with similar GDPs, Don Mueang and Suvarnabhumi Airports in Thailand consistently have high customer satisfaction ratings. Malaysia, a wealthy country, is so disappointing for its airport.

Also, airport doesn't have smoking room. One I found only works till 10pm, as if there are no flights past 10pm.

The staff doesn't know how to give clear instructions when asked or give completely wrong information !

I'd rather fly to Bangkok, Bali or elsewhere !",Negative

We were walking aimlessly and each time we passed the same way, we had to scan our hand carry! Thank God we found the transfer counter in the end!

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?!

First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. I’ve traveled through many large airports, but I’ve never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that… but what came next was even worse.

After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through a mall to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub.

We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (we’re used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle.

Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we weren’t allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 PM, which was also the listed departure time, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel.

In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there.

This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia.",Negative

"Worst immigration experience in international airports compared to other major transit airports in Asia i.e  Dubai, Doha, Istanbul and Bangkok airports.

There was this lady at the counter. She took more than 30 mins on one couple! FGS either accept or reject. Very un progressional behavior by the immigration staff.

This long wait made me miss my visit to chocolate shops as only 20 mins were left after the immigration clears. Moreover, for international departures you have to take a bus to another lounge. Which is weird for such a developed country.

"Welcome to KLIA2 (Terminal 2), one of the 2 terminal of KL International Airport - the proud home of AirAsia and every traveler who thought “budget travel” just meant a cheap ticket, not a 1.2km hike from immigration to Gate J22.

Need retail therapy at 3 a.m.? You’re in luck. Need a quiet seat with a charging port? Hah, good luck.

Stat corner: Opened in 2014 to replace the low-cost LCCT terminal, KLIA2 is the largest purpose-built terminal for low-cost carriers in the world. It’s also a maze where time and boarding calls are mere suggestions.

Still, with AirAsia’s mantra of “Now Everybody Can Fly,” this terminal proves it , whether you’re a backpacker, a broke student, or someone who accidentally booked the wrong airport entirely.

Employees like this should be retrained immediately.",Negative
"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines.

While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight.

Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member, who was shouting, to proceed to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall.

Was thinking that perhaps our flight was scheduled to park in a “further” lot due to multiple flights arriving around the same time.​
Personally, I wasn’t expecting to go through the hassle of having to transit from the plane to the arrival hall, taking into consideration that this was a direct flight.
Anyway, still went with the flow and follow those in front since we are told to....

This information could easily be missed if people are talking or focused on finding the nearest toilet.

Although the airport was large and packed with lots of shops and eateries, there are areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving/departure passengers.

​Would suggest the following improvements:

* Rather than having a staff member shouting/giving instructions, ​can consider placing clear, large signage on both sides of the walkway as passengers disembark.
* Provide more readily available information upon flight arrival​ / departure.
* Consider adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay.

Clear directional signs and information would make a big difference for first-time visitors like myself and would save a lot of time​ especially when there are so many incoming/outgoing flights day to day.....

The signage for the bus transfer was unclear, and it took approximately 4-5 minutes to find the waiting point to queue for the feeder bus to the arrival hall.

Upon arriving at the arrival hall, it was another 2-minute walk to reach immigration. The area was extremely crowded, with queues of 2-3 lines in a row, resulting in an hour-long wait to clear immigration.

The process was very disorganized and messy, with no one managing the human traffic, possibly due to a shortage of manpower.
Although the officers were friendly and efficient in clearing the queue,
it would be beneficial to have crowd control/security to guide and manage the flow of passengers.

Locating the correct baggage belt after clearing immigration was another challenge. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts, requiring passengers to walk near the belt to check the monitor screen.
This was frustrating, especially with different groups of people surrounding the area, some looking for directions, some waiting for friends, and others searching for the right belt.
We eventually found our luggage placed not far away from the luggage belt area near the exit, with a sign displaying the SQ Airlines logo on the floor.
Many unclaimed bags from our flight were present, as most passengers were still stuck in immigration.

The entire process, from disembarking the plane to retrieving our luggage outside the baggage claim area, was challenging.

I thought we were only required to transit to the arrival hall as a one-time occurrence. However, on our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall.
Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.

As a tourist, the airport gives the first impression for passengers, and its organization is crucial.

I hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements",Negative
"Very clean and all, but the reason I rate it 1 star is because of how they treat my luggage. It is emirates airlines that treated my luggage bad and so as the airport. I would rate it 0 stars but there is no option for that😔",Negative
"Very bad service from the airport people
Last year jan I was travelling to India from Indonesian there was a connecting flight  in Malaysia first I had only 2 hours of waiting only
But this batik airline they changes the rule as they need they said 8 hours of waiting this airport doesn’t have not to  eat we need to go another airport which is like 10 min in bus I really don’t know what is this first of all
When I asked the airport staff or the polis for the help they are really very bad to even say you need to go this way to buy some things they even don’t like to guide you
I don’t know what kind of service they are providing",Negative

At the immigration gate, it's still manual, there are officers who ask questions even though it's clear that you're only going to Malaysia for traveling, it's complicated, unlike in Indonesia where you only need to scan your passport.

There are quite a lot of tenants selling various foods & drinks, there are money changers too but the exchange rate is more expensive than withdrawing funds at an ATM.

The officers are also not very friendly when asked and asked for information...",Negative
"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling.  This looks fancy but very old school.
Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating

Very confusing direction or procedure. I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers
When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products.
Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority.

As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go.

Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there.

I went other less modern airport like ho chi Ming city or in Istanbul. Where still have better experience than in Malaysia",Negative
"Nice airport, efficient good signage.
Attentive staff also at security. But... can the air conditioning please be a bit less intense? Especially in the direction of the gates people are ON THE DRAUGHT. Am I the only one who suffers from this? I don't think so. Headache as a result of the strong WIND coming from the ceilings. The contrast between outside temperature and inside temperature is very big. Too big, exaggerated. It is sickening. I mean it.. Management please DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.",Negative
"The most inconvenient airport I’ve ever been to, with a very dirty environment. It definitely fails to meet the standards of an international airport.",Negative
"One of the worst airport experiences I’ve ever had. While the airport is spacious, the design is extremely confusing. Each level has two separate sides, and if you accidentally end up on the wrong one, you have to go back up and re-enter from another point – there’s no direct way to cross over.

The terminals are connected by trains, but shockingly, you’re charged 2 MYR per person just to use them! Shuttle buses are available, but only from specific areas that take at least 30 minutes of walking to reach, with no clear guidance. There are no proper information desks, and you’re left to ask random staff who often give vague or conflicting directions.

To make matters worse, baggage trolley staff were communicating using loud whistles – it was chaotic and very unpleasant. The AirAsia terminal (2) was particularly bad and felt extremely disorganized.

This experience alone is enough to make me reconsider visiting Malaysia again just to avoid going through this airport.",Negative

No one had any issues a month back when we did the same at the same spot. When asked to call someone we can have a proper discussion about it the person told us to go to information desk and had no further information regarding policies etc. and meanwhile he was clicking pictures.

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight.

Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers.
These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information.

Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member to go to C15 for a transfer to the arrival hall. Rather having a staff to shout ,wouldn't it be better to put up clear large signage at both side of the walk way while we disembark?

The signage for this bus transfer was also unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus.

Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay.

Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldn’t it be better to have basic international “standard” too?

Situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall.
The area was extremely crowded,people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration.
Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic which leads to all these mess.

After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging.
The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for.

The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when yiu have different groups of people surrounding the area....some was waiting for their friends while some was was looking for the right belt for their luggage.
Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right.

We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the Singapore Airlines logo on the floor. Quite a handful of luggage was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight were still stuck in immigration.
Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt.

Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage much of which was in Malay.
This can be rather challenging, especially after a series of such ""events"" we went through.
We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter, who knows we must go through the same things going back.

On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall.
Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.We have to endure our thirst till our flight take off.

As a tourist, I don’t enjoy it if I have to go through so much hassle. This was one of a kind of experience i wasn't expecting from KLIA...

Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.",Negative
"The organization is good, in departure mode, although there are few travelers. On the other hand, it's dirty and somewhat rundown.
At the boarding gates, it's stifling, crowded together on dirty seats.
People are outrageous and unruly.
The restrooms are okay. Lack of modernity compared to the modernism displayed in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
Needs interior design.
I didn't expect it to be like Singapore airport, but better nonetheless.

In arrival mode, it's indeed confusing 🤷‍♀️ where are the luggage??? And if you're arriving from a two-hour flight and have a jet lag, it's very complicated.
Nothing or very little is written.

The taxis are all waiting to take you and charge you €30 to get to the center; I'm surprised they pay that price. By the way, to come I paid 17€ via booking and it was perfect 👍",Negative
"The airport looks very fancy and all - at least Terminal 1. It is very unorganized though. We arrived extremely late from our first flight (thank you batik air) and only had 15-20min items to get our connecting flight. Normally airports would provide a shuttle services, picking you from a gate to bring you to your connecting flight in time. This was not the case here, we were only told the gate number of our connecting flight, which after running to for 10min, turned out to be the wrong gate. So instead we had to take the bus to another terminal, which obviously did not give us enough time to catch our flight, so we were stuck in KL for 1 night. Additionally it is ridiculous, that there is no smoking area in the entirety of terminal 1. So if you are stuck here for a while you have to go all the way to terminal 2, into one of the most disgusting smoking rooms I’ve witnessed in my life (no ventilation at all, might as well just walk in and breath twice and you’ve already passively smoked a carton of cigarettes). Really disappointing for such a modern (only t1) and large airport.",Negative

"Arriving:
Immigration for arrivals took too long! The officers works so slowly and the poor internet connection in this area is not helping either. It took us long enough to complete immigration to the point that our bags were no longer in the conveyor belt/shown on screen. Pick up location of ride hailing (Grab) was easy at Level 1.

Departure:
Check in counters are spread out making it not too crowded/congested. Immigration for departure is quicker and easier. However, there's a security screening for customs departure that was separated with at-gate security check. I would say this is very inefficient as you need to check your bags twice and once you have cleared security you practically cannot go out to the retail area. In addition, the post-security gate is a nightmare with neither water stations nor proper toilet! There seems to be no signs of priority boarding based on group but rather by seats (not sure if this is an MH or KLIA problem). Retail space is decent with great tax-free goods options and decent restaurant selections. One thing to appreciate: the toilets (in retail & public) areas are clean and equipped with jet showers.",Negative

"Exhausting.. you need to have atleast a year of airport work experience to just transit through this airport. It took nearly 2 hrs from landing to sitting down at our gate.  So much is automated and so few staff members to help. So many more hurdles to jump such as filling in an MDAC, yes, we were asked to fill it in on-line at Siem Reap, but thought it couldn't possibly be for us as so many 'mandatory' boxes were irrelevant to us. However, at the airport, they insisted we filled it in with a bunch of false information, i.e. the address where we would be staying (had to put in an they address provided.. which was the airport's address) a waste of time, as we felt we could miss our connecting flight. We also had to create our own baggage tags, then TWO separate baggage screenings - so unnecessary. So many options of queues without clear instructions, so many people, so much walking - just seems chaotic. Not my favourite airport.",Negative

"Arrived at Kuala Lumpur in the late afternoon, and the queue at immigration was very long. We got in and waited about 15 minutes, when we left there were 2-3 times as many people, so they must have waited for over 30 minutes.

There are not many officers. But the thing that annoyed the most, was the lack of transparency regarding the newly introduced MDAC that every foreigner needs to fill in. About 20% of the people in the queue wait for a long time, and then when coming to the immigration officer they did not fill in the MDAC and the foreigner is redirected to the back again to fill it in. It is a waste of time for people waiting, the immigration officers and for the people who did not fill it in.

It is very simple, put some signage to be clear at the start of the queue. ""Did you fill in your MDAC?"". If not, fill it in first. I literally filled it in in 2 minutes while I was in the long queue.

Sure, everyone needs to do their own research. But from a big airport like Kuala Lumpur, this is terrible organization and messes with people who have connecting flights.",Negative

"I was assaulted by a female airport customer experience officer who attempted to physically restrain me without justification. When I demanded to file a police report, I was told I would have to go to Terminal 2—something my Australian emergency passport did not permit. Despite my repeated requests, the airport police refused to take my report and instead escorted me to the immigration department.

There, I was met by an aggressive and unprofessional immigration officer named Kamarudin. When I asked for his full name in writing, he refused and rudely pointed to his name badge, telling me to take a photo with my phone. The moment I did, he became enraged and began intimidating me—even going so far as to take photos of me and my passport on his personal phone. This was a blatant violation of privacy and professional conduct.

**Malaysia’s airport authorities and immigration officers behaved in a disgusting, abusive, and unaccountable manner. Travelers beware: AVOID MALAYSIA at all costs!**

**Legal Analysis**
This conduct raises multiple violations under Malaysian law:

1. **Assault and Criminal Force (Penal Code Sections 350-352)**
The staff member's actions in grabbing my arms and physically restraining me without consent constitutes criminal force under Section 350. Case precedent (PP v. Mohd Anuar bin Abdullah [1994] 2 MLJ 261) confirms that any intentional use of force without lawful justification meets this threshold.

2. **Wrongful Confinement (Penal Code Section 340)**
The unlawful restriction of my movement within the clinic treatment room amounts to wrongful confinement. Malaysian jurisprudence establishes that detention without legal authority is punishable, particularly where no legitimate lien exists over the person.

3. **Official Misconduct**
The behavior of Immigration Officer Kamarudin in:
- Failing to properly address a criminal complaint
- Intimidating a complainant
- Improper use of personal devices to photograph sensitive documents
May constitute offenses under Malaysia's official misconduct provisions.

UPDATE: Malaysian Airport Management have promised a full investigation of this matter however no official response as of yet.",Negative
Impressive this time! They charged us for the medical breathing machine (CPAP) which they never do this before! My luggage 7 KG but still they weight the breathing machine bag too which it 3 KG🤣.

It’s better to board the gates in L section before an hour or two.

At the gate you're asked to provide a printed boarding card even if you have an online booking.  These are available from a desk immediately next to the gate clerk, which the airline could print out in preparation, if they were better organised

Travelers are also unfriendly and loud. Not KLIAs fault, but nobody seems to care. Cellphones everywhere playing all kind of videos, loud phone calls, and playing music that's just horrible.
The rain forest thing seems a joke to me. Nice idea, but its advertised as if its huge. It's not, its small. Nice view through a window inside it, because it was closed and I have no idea if its normally open to enter.
When I went through security it felt to easy, and it was. It seems gates have a second security point. No clear lines, no communication, and everyone is pushing and pulling to get through. Staff dont seem to care. I almost missed my flight because there were 4 lines for 1 gate and nobody knew who could go through. Add some clear lines or something.

Two positive things: arriving is pretty simple and quick. And when leaving I know I will be in a plane at some point.",Negative
"Clean airport. There's a serious lack of rest areas. The seats aren't comfortable, and everything is brightly lit.",Negative
"I've been there several times. The worst airport I've ever had the misfortune to travel through. Everything is very poorly organized, with poor signs and poor layout.",Negative
"One of the worst airport experiences I’ve ever had. While the airport is spacious, the design is extremely confusing. Each level has two separate sides, and if you accidentally end up on the wrong one, you have to go back up and re-enter from another point – there’s no direct way to cross over.

The terminals are connected by trains, but shockingly, you’re charged 2 MYR per person just to use them! Shuttle buses are available, but only from specific areas that take at least 30 minutes of walking to reach, with no clear guidance. There are no proper information desks, and you’re left to ask random staff who often give vague or conflicting directions.

To make matters worse, baggage trolley staff were communicating using loud whistles – it was chaotic and very unpleasant. The AirAsia terminal (2) was particularly bad and felt extremely disorganized.

This experience alone is enough to make me reconsider visiting Malaysia again just to avoid going through this airport.",Negative

So its better to arrive the Airport before time...",Negative
"Please re-design the international arrival pathways, especially when arriving to the terminal which is separated from the main departure area (travellers are ferried by bus between these 2 terminals).

Improve the signage for heaven’s sake.",Negative
"Very bad airport the immigration officer is toooo slow he made me lose my plane with take off without me with my bags and no one to spoke with him 
The worst airport you can deal with their deadly slow passport officers they caused me to miss my flight time and no one wants to reply to me and the PR girls don't want me to bring a manager to blame them for their mistake and Qatar Airways took off without me and my bags were on the plane the height of negligence and indifference from both passports and Qatar Airways",Negative

Then we went out moving to towards the arrival gate. Along the way, we saw all the round shape lifts moving up to upper M-floor closed for maintenance too.. Another surprise maintenance system.

Why e-gates can’t be extended to many more countries like in Singapore. Singapore is right next door and should serve as an example of how to do things. This makes the country easy to visit and enticing for visitors. Entry via KLIA is a real turn-off to entering Malaysia. Unfortunately no-one seems to care. No organisation / queue management, no-one checking on people considering the long wait (many elderly, children etc), even to offer water etc.",Negative
"We flew with Batik Air and had to go to Gate G8. After check-in, you go through passport control for international flights. Then there's a backpack check, where you have to put all your bags and backpacks through the scanner. Your body isn't scanned, though, so it's not a proper security check. After that, you're in the duty-free area and can walk to the gates. We bought some food and drinks to take with us onto the plane. Unfortunately, there was a proper security check before Gates G8 and G10, so we had to empty and dispose of all liquids there. After this point, you're in the waiting area and aren't given any drinks or food.",Negative

"Absolutely horrible check in process at Malaysia airport. I arrived at the aiport at 6 AM, 3 hours before my 9 AM flight, only to see a line of 500 people in front of me everyone checking in for Malaysia airlines flights at different times. Some people checking in for 11 AM flight and getting in the line.

I had already done web check in, I had printed luggage tags and boarding pass, I just wanted to drop off my check in bag and go to my terminal for breakfast. But the whole process was organised so horribly that I was in the line for 1 hour only to check in my bag. Then another hour to reach my terminal and then 45 mins in line for boarding. I didnt get to have any breakfast  or relax before my flight.

Flight was delayed by 30+ mins on tarmac. Shame on Malaysia airlines and Malaysia airport for such terrible management. Next time I am going to buy Batik Air tickets.",Negative
"Such a bad airport to leave via. Takes ages to get to some gates, multiple security checks and all the shops are before security so you can’t buy water for your flight.

"When I arrived in Kuala Lumpur it took 2.5 hours to clear the immigration line.  When I left it took 40 minutes.  A reasonable time anywhere in the world is less than 20 min.

The toilet seats in the airport are far too small and designed for a home not a commercial setting like an airport.  Bangkok airport is far better.  This airport has a Google rating of 4.2.  I suspect it's like the restaurants and hotels in Malaysia, 80% fake 5 star reviews.",Negative

The gate is open at 13:40, we have arrived at on time and the officer say” get out get out 3 times in Malay “ we asked why, the gate is already open and the announce also, they said the time is wrong and don’t know… really !!!!!

If the time is wrong and gate is open already, don’t be rude officer, we are not late at all, we do come on time.

Hopefully its not happen work your career

"Unfortunately, my bag was stolen by a thief inside the airport, and the security did not respond to me as required. The flight was in transit. For your information, there are gangs inside the airport who steal from my bag. When I filed a complaint, they did not let me through. I think that the airport police are cooperating with them because they did not address my problem fairly, or because my passport is not American or European for them to care about the problem. I gave them all the information, but unfortunately they did not help me. It is the worst airport in terms of security, and they do not give you your rights.",Negative

I am stunned. I dont know if KLIA management even care to give a training to the ground staff on how to help people. or is it they expect customer just ask where is the toilet. i am not talking about a ground staff, there are 3 4 staff there too but none of them helping properly, finally there is one staff with brain, go infront and see which line actually we need to queue. thanks to her, i managed to get onboard.",Negative
Absolute chaos and security risk at this airport. People pushing in and security took no action of this at the security scans. We felt unsafe with the total lack of control the staff had.

"First and Last Time!

It's my first time in Malaysia, traveling from Abu Dhabi. As a UAE resident, I take pride in the excellent regulations we have. However, I had a very disappointing experience at Kuala Lumpur Airport with a police officer named Azhar, who was checking baggage. He removed several of our items, including our shower gel, face wash, moisturizer, perfume, mouthwasher (almost finished the bottle)and even drinking water as well. My wife and I have never encountered such treatment at any airport before, and we were shocked to learn that these items are considered ""non-carryable"" on flights, the things cost more than 500 AED, very disappointed, and will never come again worst experience ever.

"over years klia I & klia II has been quite the smooth transportation for flyers both domestic and international. unfortunately there also were some unpleasant experiences many flyers had encountered or witnessed. personally often noticed such unpleasant incidences happening, for example, 2 ineffectively handling at heavily heaving airline check-in counters ( a python long queue today),  on-going passengers at transit train between terminals ( in the mean time the sky train rosak that airport authorities addressed the issue with buses yet effective though), at the immigration (remember seeing poor innocent south asians were shouted to and treated with discriminative manners, rude and loudly likely a racial verbal abuse. it was a moment of unbearable injustice towards humanity), at baggage claim, at security checks or even at Whsmiths, ffs. today it was still leaving flyers compromising authorities were seemed proactively dealing with situation.

"Separate security control at each gate. I can consider it ok when departing from this airport. But when transferring it is extremely inconvenient. Moreover, at C gates there are no toilets after this security check what is completely unacceptable.

Not even worth one star. The moment you enter the country you’ll get scolded by the immigration for coming to the counter together with your partner even though there are plenty of people do the same in other counters. So if you get a shitty officer they will ruin your trip. I faced this with a lady at the immigration who was extremely moody early morning. Without any hesitation she vented it on the tourists. Imagine you get screamed at once you land in the country that you are going to spend your money in! The worst airport I’ve ever been to out of so many countries I’ve travelled to. What a terrible first impression! Grow up Malaysia 👍🏻. We are not illegal immigrants.,Negative

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?!

First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. I’ve traveled through many large airports, but I’ve never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that… but what came next was even worse.

After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub.

We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (we’re used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle.

Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we weren’t allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, ""because it's too late now to buy tickets"" (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel.

In the end, we paid almost triple the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there.

And also, the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration! I had such a hard time to book the Grab taxi and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, in any airport that's when wifi is needed!! But here there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!!

I've never had this much hastle and wasted time to manage to exit an airport, oh yeah, and the airport is so far away from the city it took us 90 minutes to reach the hotel (with zero traffic after midnight) knowing this, the designers still decided to add a mall to make your trip even slower!

This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia. I've never thought an airport would affect my will to visit a country but here we are.",Negative

Security lines are excessively long.
Departure gates are closed with passengers still stuck in queues.
Malaysia Airlines staff have been unhelpful and, in some cases, outright rude.
No clear communication or assistance provided to stressed travelers.
This experience reflects a serious lack of coordination between Malaysia Airlines and airport authorities. I strongly advise others to avoid flying with MYA until basic service and operational standards are improved.",Negative

"A more than bad experience... I arrived at the airport at 7:00 AM, and went directly to wrap my large bag. There were only two people in front of me, but the wrapping took longer than expected. When I got to the baggage check-in counter, I found the queue very long, and my turn didn't come until 8:15 AM!!! The flight gate opened... When I finished, I didn't know where to go to find the gate, so I asked one of the employees, and her response was very... When she left, she started mocking me in front of the shop owners, as she imitated the way I spoke in front of them. I didn't have time to stop her because this is a disrespectful way to treat tourists and guests in general... Anyway, when I finally got to the bus stop, I found another queue, and we went to the bus, thank God... But the surprise was that there was another inspection before boarding the plane!!!! This caused the backlog and queues again!!!! One of the worst airport experiences in my life. Unprofessional and slow employees, poor airport management and organization. Finally, the plane didn't take off after this chaos until half an hour after the official takeoff time, and I was forced to stand during these three hours because of the boring and tiring queues. A bad experience by all standards.",Negative
"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was shockingly poor and has completely soured my view of Malaysia.  Arriving late at night, I was met with an appalling three-hour wait in the immigration queue.  With only two counters open, the already tired and frustrated passengers were subjected to rude and unprofessional behavior from the immigration officers.  One officer, who identified himself as Nizam, was particularly aggressive, yelling at passengers and making demeaning comments about their attempts to use the biometric scanners.  His dismissive attitude and condescending tone were echoed by other staff members, creating a hostile and uncomfortable atmosphere for everyone, including families with young children.
The situation worsened when, due to the extensive delay, our luggage was removed from the baggage carousel.  This added further stress and inconvenience to an already exhausting experience. It felt as though the immigration staff treated their positions as some sort of celebrity status, rather than a service role.
The impact of this disastrous airport experience rippled through my entire trip.  I had to cancel some planned tourist attractions due to the excessive wait times I encountered elsewhere, including another two-hour queue.  My children were exhausted, and our holiday was ultimately ruined.
As if the airport ordeal wasn't enough, our tourist vehicle was later stopped by police for a seemingly pointless immigration check, resulting in another hour-long delay.  This unnecessary display of authority felt like a final insult.
It's ironic that Malaysia's economy relies heavily on tourism, yet visitors are treated with such disrespect.  This entire experience was so negative that I will never visit Malaysia again.  It's truly a shame, as I had hoped for a much more positive experience.",Negative

I bought 3 cans  7up to drink during the flight after the security, alrdy in the airside, they took it off me, right before boarding the plane !

There's a security search right before entering the gate (what could have happened after the main security check point and the gate?! Money making point, to take off sealed drinks from pax, bought in duty free!)

Have never seen idiotic rule like that, when you buy smth in the duty free after check in and security and they take it from you before entering the plane 🤦‍♀️

Also, airport doesn't have smoking room. One I found only works till 10pm, as if there are no flights past 10pm. Logic?!

The staff doesn't know how to give clear instructions when asked or give completely wrong information !

I mean..never again.

I'd rather fly to Bangkok, Bali or elsewhere!",Negative

"KLIA Terminal 1 is the worst airport in the world. I bought a drink at one of the shops inside the airport, but when I went through the gate security check, I was not allowed to bring my drink with me. What’s the point of the airport authorities allowing shops to sell items if those very products are considered a threat to aviation and are banned by airport security?

As for the boarding process, it was very racist, as passengers with passports from certain countries were prioritized, while others from different countries were treated as second-class. Is this really worthy of being called an international airport when there is still discrimination in how passengers from different nationalities are treated?

Perhaps I will never visit Malaysia again due to this terrible experience at KLIA Terminal 1",Negative
"(Emerites specifically from KL).. KL is a beautiful airport, super clean, very convenient with English signs everywhere- with many options for drink and food land side before security - coffee, mcdonald’s, taco bell and high end malaysian restaurants. NOTE: the few Emirates flights that leave from here, despite what you may read, have NO bag drop, have no kiosks to print your bag tag or boarding pass, and if you are checking a bag you have to stand in the forever line with people going to Dubai with 5 giant suitcases. Not having an Emirates bag drop or kiosk is ridiculous.",Negative

"The new arrival system for cars is terrible. The system could be made more efficient but it is currently extremely a bottleneck and causing terrible traffic jam for cars intending to drop off. The worst traffic system at an airport I have seen, and the worst at KLIA since Subang airport years.

Please do a better study of more efficient systems. The way it is makes me think that there is no thinking done by the management. It’s not the guards. It’s the system itself- closing off 2 lanes every few meters. There seems to be no purpose beyond troubling customers and passengers.

Impossible for small children to stand in queue for over two and a half hours

"Chaotic. We flew British Airways business class and it wasn't clear that we needed to go to gate G1, downstairs and take a bus to C gates, where Golden Lounge is. We walked around the main terminal being sent in random directions before being told the right information. At check in, we should have been told go to Gate G1 and take a bus.

The Golden Lounge was very large. The bar is right near the entrance, so sit near there if you want to have a drink or two. Obviously the serving of alcohol is controlled here. I ordered two sparkling wines; one for my partner too but I was only served one.  I had to ask for the second one and I felt judged for doing so. The glasses were small and the wine wasn't good.

There was lots of hot food choices; far more than any other business lounge I have been too. Sandwiches, pasta and noodles made to order. Lots of other self-serve foods too.

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines. While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight.

Although the airport is large and packed with many shops and eateries, there are a few areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving passengers.
These include having clearer directional signs/ large screen and more readily available information.

Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member to go to C15 for a transfer to the arrival hall. Rather having a staff to shout ,wouldn't it be better to put up clear signage at both side of the walk way while we disembark?

The signage for this bus transfer was unclear, and it took us a while to find the area just to queue for a feeder bus.

Would also suggest considering adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay.

Since this airport is named as an international airport, wouldn’t it be better to have basic international “standard” too?

Situation worsened upon arrival at the arrival hall.
The area was extremely crowded,people are in queue of 2 -3 lines in a row....resulting in a queue of over an hour just to clear immigration.
Very disorganized and messy, no one was there to direct the human traffic which leads to all these mess.

After clearing immigration, locating the correct baggage belt was challenging.
The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts where you needed to walk near the belt to check on the medium-sized monitor screen showing which flight these belts are meant for.

The screen flashed so fast with so many people trying to catch a glimpse of the information, which was rather frustrating, especially when yiu have different groups of people surrounding the area....some was waiting for their friends while some was was looking for the right belt for their luggage.
Literally, many passengers were visibly struggling to find their luggage, moving up and down, left and right.

We only found our luggage outside the luggage belt area, where there was a sign with the Singapore Airlines logo on the floor. Quite a handful of luggage was located there, which obviously most of those taking the same flight were still stuck in immigration.
Imagine the time taken from the moment we disembark from the plane and just to get out until our luggage was left outside and not at the belt.

Navigating the airport area to find a Grab was also confusing due to the signage much of which was in Malay.
This can be rather challenging, especially after a series of such ""events"" we went through.
We thought maybe this is common for arrival passengers to encounter, who knows we must go through the same things going back.

On our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall.
Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.We have to endure our thirst till our flight take off.

As a tourist, I don’t enjoy it if I have to go through so much hassle. This was one of a kind of experience i wasn't expecting from KLIA...

Hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements.",Negative

"We were at the immigration lines for foreign passports. The section we were at had only 1 counter opened while other sections had at least 3. When the line kept building up the airport directed people who just arrived to go to newly opened sections.

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling.  This looks fancy but very old school.
Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating

Very confusing direction or procedure given.
I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers
When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products.
Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate when leaving from KL to overseas. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority.
Airline still tier off the ticket manually.

As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go.

Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there.

"My recent experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was unfortunately extremely disappointing.

Firstly, the staff were generally unfriendly and appeared to have minimal understanding of English, which made basic communication difficult to impossible.
More critically, there was a noticeable general incompetence across various functions. Staff seemed unable or unwilling to perform their duties, such as overseeing passengers and maintaining order in the queues. In this context, I repeatedly observed an absolute lack of professional supervision, where people were simply allowed to cut in line or where queues dissolved into chaos without any staff intervention.
An additional major point of inefficiency was the self-service process: I was directed to the scanner by immigration staff, only for the scanner to then instruct me to return to the immigration counter, causing further unnecessary delays and frustration.

Furthermore, the signage (wayfinding) was poor, often unclear, and lacked sufficient repetition throughout the terminal, making navigation difficult.

To top it all off, there was also a lack of seating at the airport itself, and the seats that were available were often taken up by a single person lying down across three seats, leaving people who wanted to sit with nowhere to go.

This combination of poor (and by times even disrespectful) customer service, language barriers, failure to enforce basic operational procedures and the lack of seating led to unnecessary stress and delays. It's clear that KLIA urgently needs to invest in significantly better training for its personnel, focusing on customer service, language proficiency, and core job efficiency.

"My second trip through Kuala Lumpur International Airport was unfortunately just as frustrating as the first.

The customer service here is a huge problem. I asked multiple staff members for help with basic info, and every single one just shrugged, said ""I don't know"" and acted like it wasn't their job. There was zero effort to even try and find out. It's truly baffling.

Then there's the internal airport bus with no proper monitoring. We had our 5-month-old with us and we literally had to stand for a 5-minute ride between gates. The bus wasn't even packed but everyone was too busy hogging their spot to offer one up to someone struggling with a baby. The fear of losing balance and dropping our infant was terrifying. People just sat there watching us, completely uncaring.

To top it off, we saw a couple of electric buggies nearby, clearly for passenger assistance, but there was no one to drive them! We asked four different staff if they could help us get one, and each time, we got the same clueless ""I don't know"" response.

For an international airport, the lack of basic help and common courtesy is really poor. Traveling with a baby is already tough enough, and KLIA just made it worse. I'll definitely be trying to avoid this airport next time.",Negative

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?!

First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. I’ve traveled through many large airports, but I’ve never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that… but what came next was even worse.

After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through a mall to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub.

We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (we’re used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle.

Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we weren’t allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 PM, which was also the listed departure time, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel.

In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there.

This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia.",Negative

"I’ve traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always stood out for its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, is a beautiful highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of foreign and unique local offerings.

With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where it’s due- the new bathrooms are a massive improvement! Well-designed, clean, and dry. But I can’t ignore the disappointing shift in retail and dining options. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. Also why is alcohol and tobacco taking up a large portion of the retail space every time? I was shocked to find only one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a foodie haven—why isn’t KLIA showcasing its rich culinary heritage and  diversity?

Gone are the great local options that once served authentic dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles and teh tarik. Instead, global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jean’s dominate the F&B spaces. Surely, there’s room for more homegrown eateries that represent Malaysia’s incredible food culture?

To add to the frustration, the monorail is still not working, and travelers have to rely on shuttle buses- slow and less efficient. And when I asked an ‘Ask Me For Help’ staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone—customer service should be better than this.

A woman came over asking us - a few people were here waiting - where we were going. Then told us “out”, “wait outside”. No sorry, no explanation, and the attitude was not good .
They didn’t check or ask before you went through the safety check. After you’ve done everything - empty water bottles, take off the shoes… - eventually went through, then kicking you out. You have to do that again later.
I have traveled a lot, been to many airports. These people here are the worst I have ever seen. Lazy and irresponsible people!

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling.  This looks fancy but very old school.
Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating

Very confusing direction or procedure given.
I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers
When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products.
Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate when leaving from KL to overseas. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority.
Airline still tier off the ticket manually.

As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go.

Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there.

"The airport is very new and clearly marked. When I visited two years ago, there was no tram available. This time, it's been repaired, making it very convenient to take the tram directly to the departure area. There are plenty of shops, but prices are quite high. One downside is that once you enter the departure lounge, you have to check your carry-on luggage again. If you bought something in the duty-free shop or food court, you can bring it to the VIP lounge. You can't even bring water with you. It's really strange. You have to leave the departure lounge to use the restroom, which is really inconvenient.",Negative

I was next she saw me and told me to go too and doesn’t even let me to go closer to the counter.

We went to the immigration office and waited 6 hour for our number and when we were called the officer just asked me 2 questions literally 2 questions:
1 - How long you gonna stay.
2- Do you have a hotel booking.

I was so heartbroken to hear these questions which the first officer could have asked me at the first place.

I told the officer at the immigration about this whole scenario and she was shocked by herself and told me that she should not have sent me here and ask these questions by herself.

Literally ruined my whole day almost 11 hours at the airport. Really disappointed because i was not expecting this kind of behaviour by a country which i was very excited to visit.

If my review finds any person in charge please look into this matter. I know there are people who enters the country for illegal purposes like slipping or so but what about the legit tourists? There were hundreds of people dealing with the same thing.

One particularly notable time recently was I waited so long to check in my baggage and we had told the staff our flight was soon. When I finally arrived at the counter the woman  was fussing about. I asked her five times if there was an issue, and after ignoring me all those times she eventually told me my flight was boarding, so I’d have to take the next flight. Once I asked her what the next time was she said 5pm, this meant I would have been stranded in Thailand with no accommodation as I needed to get a boat to where I was going.

Because Indonesian and Japanese passports are handled differently, I couldn't see her face. Suddenly, she said, ""You're rude! Why are you looking at me like that? You're rude."" The female staff member with a Malay face said that. I said, ""I've been quiet, not talking to you, and I haven't looked at you. Why are you coming to me? My face is like this. I've only been looking at my husband."" When I get back from Malaysia, I'll take a picture of that immigration officer. He was on duty with a woman wearing a headscarf.

"For such a major international hub, the airport felt a little confusing and chaotic. We ran into the same issue two times - once on arrival (for transit) and once for departure.

During arrival we wanted to switch from C Gates to A/B gates for domestic departure but it was confusing to find the directions.

Exactly at the same location, during departure, we had to switch to C gates but got confused. We later realised that one of the sign boards is actually wrong. It points to an escalator upwards that goes into the shopping area. Whereas the C gates entry is exactly in the opposite direction of the sign. For an international airport this is not acceptable at all. I dont have photos, but getting confused at the same place two times is not right. We saw a few others get confused too.

Apart from that there is no major security check and body scan before immigration. However this is done prior to boarding. This is not as per standard processes elsewhere wherein the detailed security check and body scan is done immediately at entry.

"KLIA is so huge, the potential clinical coldness of the facility is cleverly softened with what appears to be an atrium of greenery.
The once state of the art facilities of this Airport is marred by the breakdown of the Aerotrain system that used to provide a world class service between the terminals.
The Aerotrain gates have been hidden behind dark but colourful hoarding. Opposite the hoarding are lines of waiting passengers queuing to enter the various B gates, together with their various hand carry items. With poor lighting due to the height of the dark colourd hoarding,  this creates a somewhat long dark narrow somber passage that arriving visitors to Malaysia must navigate to reach the escalators to the ground level and transfer bus terminal.
Any negative impressions arising from negotiating past the queuing passengers with unsettled infants and the ocassional unrestrained child darting into the crowd flow is further accentuated as one reaches the ground level and confronted by the multinational crowd chaos at the
Satellite Terminal bus transfer gate.
The airport employees manning the area do a great job in moving the crowd in arbitrary groups onto the waiting buses. Despite the apparent crowd chaos, these Malaysian employees at various informal ""gates"" manage to prevent a crowd surge and create controlled access on to the buses. These lowly front line employees are the true heroes in this situation and are living examples of the ""Malaysia Boleh"" can-do attitude.

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines.

While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight.

Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member, who was shouting, to proceed to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall by bus.

Was thinking that perhaps our flight was scheduled to park in a “further” lot due to multiple flights arriving around the same time,which requires us to do a short transit.
Personally, I wasn’t expecting to go through the hassle of having to transit from the plane to the arrival hall, taking into consideration that this was a direct flight.
Anyway, still went with the flow and follow those in front since we are told to....

This information could easily be missed if people are talking or focused on finding the nearest toilet.

Although the airport was large and packed with lots of shops and eateries, there are areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving/departure passengers.

​Would suggest the following improvements:

* Rather than having a staff member shouting/giving instructions, ​can consider placing clear, large signage on both sides of the walkway as passengers disembark.
* Provide more readily available information upon flight arrival​ / departure.
* Consider adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay.

Clear directional signs and information would make a big difference for first-time visitors like myself and would save a lot of time​ especially when there are so many incoming/outgoing flights day to day.....

The signage for the bus transfer was unclear, and it took approximately 4-5 minutes to find the waiting point to queue for the feeder bus to the arrival hall.

Upon arriving at the arrival hall, it was another 2-minute walk to reach immigration. The area was extremely crowded, with queues of 2-3 lines in a row, resulting in an hour-long wait to clear immigration.

The process was very disorganized and messy, with no one managing the human traffic, possibly due to a shortage of manpower.
Although the officers were friendly and efficient in clearing the queue,
it would be beneficial to have crowd control/security to guide and manage the flow of passengers.

Locating the correct baggage belt after clearing immigration was another challenge. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts, requiring passengers to walk near the belt to check the monitor screen.
This was frustrating, especially with different groups of people surrounding the area, some looking for directions, some waiting for friends, and others searching for the right belt.
We eventually found our luggage placed not far away from the luggage belt area near the exit, with a sign displaying the SQ Airlines logo on the floor.
Many unclaimed bags from our flight were present, as most passengers were still stuck in immigration.

The entire process, from disembarking the plane to retrieving our luggage outside the baggage claim area, was challenging.

I thought we were only required to transit to the arrival hall as a one-time occurrence. However, on our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall.
Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.

As a tourist, the airport gives the first impression for passengers, and its organization is crucial.

I hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements",Negative

Waited for an hour and 30mins for the luggages from Kansai, Osaka flight at arrival belt. 3 flights passenger waited at the same belt, all luggage was mixed-up, super messy. Shame on you KLIA1 !!!

This is not the first time but every single time when I’m back to Malaysia, minimum waiting time for the luggage surely 20mins or longer. Whether is before pandemic 4 years back or after pandemic, still the same!

Hire more staffs if you can’t cope with too many flights touching down and if the ground staff is not capable of handling and organising it, pay more and get better employee!

"Extremely Poor Experience with Malaysia Airlines and Airport Authority
I’ve been standing in queue for over 2 hours, and the situation is completely mismanaged. All departing flights are being funneled through a single security gate, creating chaos, overcrowding, and confusion.

Security lines are excessively long.
Departure gates are closed with passengers still stuck in queues.
Malaysia Airlines staff have been unhelpful and, in some cases, outright rude.
No clear communication or assistance provided to stressed travelers.
This experience reflects a serious lack of coordination between Malaysia Airlines and airport authorities. I strongly advise others to avoid flying with MYA until basic service and operational standards are improved.",Negative
"This is by far the worst airport I have ever been to. It is completely disorganized and chaotic. The signage is extremely unclear, and it’s not obvious where you need to go. The staff has no idea what they’re doing and keeps sending people in the wrong directions. I have rarely seen such incompetent staff anywhere. They are unwilling to help and very unfriendly. On top of that, the boarding ticket stained my passport, causing the automatic gates not to work anymore, and now my passport is damaged. I will make sure to avoid traveling through Kuala Lumpur in the future.",Negative
"When I arrived in Kuala Lumpur it took 2.5 hours to clear the immigration line.  When I left it took 40 minutes.  A reasonable time anywhere in the world is less than 20 min.  Imagine how much time is wasted!!  The stench of body odor, especially while standing in line, is enough to keep you away from the city and this airport.  The toilet seats in the airport are far too small and designed for a home not a commercial setting like an airport.  Thailand is far better.  This airport has a Google rating of 4.2.  I suspect it's like the restaurants and hotels in Malaysia, 80% fake 5 star reviews.",Negative
"The airport is good, but the double checks that prevent you from keeping a bottle of water purchased after the first security check are really not great... Being able to take water on the plane is still a minimum, especially considering the price at which it is sold after the check",Negative
"I had a deeply frustrating and disappointing experience at Kuala Lumpur Airport due to the unprofessionalism and rudeness of the staff. Upon arrival, I realized I had accidentally left my luggage in the restroom near the baggage claim. When I approached the information desk to ask for help, I received conflicting and unhelpful instructions. Some staff told me to go to the second floor, while others asked me to use an invalid boarding pass to re-enter security (which was impossible since my ticket was for a domestic flight from Kota Kinabalu).

I ended up running back and forth between the second and third floors more than ten times, but no one took responsibility or provided any real assistance. Desperate, I approached a female staff member at the exit to request her help in checking the restroom for my luggage. Not only was she extremely reluctant, but she also glared at me in a hostile manner. After being persuaded by her colleague, she finally went to check the restroom. Within less than a minute, she came back and coldly told me my luggage wasn’t there, claiming to have confirmed with the cleaning staff.

However, this was simply not possible. Two hours later, left with no other options, I asked a passenger who hadn’t exited yet to help me check the restroom. In just three minutes, they returned with my luggage.

This experience was utterly unacceptable. The staff’s lack of professionalism, unwillingness to help, and outright rudeness made an already stressful situation even worse. An airport should prioritize assisting passengers, not adding to their frustration. I hope the management will take serious steps to train their staff to ensure such incidents don’t happen again.",Negative

"Unfortunately, my experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport was disappointing. Here are a few points that struck me negatively:
1. Strict baggage control, but not consistent:
My hand luggage was accurately weighed, and even though it was only slightly over 7kg, I was told to pay extra. At the same time, the Malaysian woman in front of me, weighing almost 8 kg, was allowed to walk away - that felt unfair.
2. Poor Signage:
Some gates had no numbers, which was extremely confusing. It was difficult to find the right path.
3. Lack of seating:
There were no seats at the gate, which made the wait unnecessarily tiring.
4. Inadequate Toilets:
The women's restrooms were a mess - I waited in line for over 30 minutes and when it was finally my turn, they were dirty. The men apparently had enough toilets as there were no queues.
Last but not least, our flight was delayed.
Unfortunately, the airport was the worst I've ever been to.",Negative

Dear traveler, do NOT use ""taxi"" that waiting at the airport. They ""offer"" you a ride for rm300-400. You should only get a ride via ehailing service, I recommended BOLT. A ride from airport to Kuala Lumpur should not exceed RM80, MAX. If a 4 seats it RM50 MAX. If you book an ehailing, driver can't ask more money from you. Pay what in the app. If driver ask for more money, record them & car number plate, and go to police station to submit a report.

"One of the worst airport experiences I’ve ever had. Immigration alone took more than 2 hours, followed by 45 minutes at customs. The officers were consistently rude, arrogant, and completely unprofessional — no courtesy, no efficiency, just laziness on full display.

To make things worse, the airport itself is extremely poorly managed. Signs are unclear and confusing, and there are no staff around to guide or assist passengers. You’re left standing in endless queues without any explanation, while officers act like they’re doing you a favor by simply being there.

"The experience at this airport is nothing short of disgraceful. Staff are unprofessional, careless, and shockingly rude. Instead of guiding passengers, they raise their voices and shout in people’s faces, turning simple situations into unnecessary stress.

The process is chaotic: passengers are forced through security three times, and reaching the gate feels like an exhausting obstacle course. There is no friendliness, no respect, and certainly no sense of hospitality.

On top of that, if you bring dutyfree cigarettes purchased from another airport, they will either confiscate them or force you to pay tax more than their actual value. It feels less like an international airport and more like a place designed to exploit travelers.",Negative

"This was by far the worst and most unacceptable experience I’ve ever had with any airline. At the Batik Air baggage counter in Kuala Lumpur before flight OD171 to Denpasar, I was shouted at, threatened, and pressured into paying a baggage fee of 650 MYR, with the amount changing several times without explanation. First it was more, then less, then suddenly 650 – it was chaotic and clearly unprofessional.

The staff member at the baggage scale used aggressive language, raised their voice, and intimidated me in front of other passengers. I felt unsafe and coerced. This was not a normal excess baggage fee – it felt like extortion. I complied because I felt I had no choice.

This is absolutely not the standard I expect from any airline, especially not from Batik Air, which previously had my trust. I have filed a formal complaint with the airline and am awaiting a refund and investigation.

I strongly warn other travelers: If you’re flying from Kuala Lumpur with Batik Air, be cautious at the baggage counter. Keep records, film interactions, and don’t let yourself be bullied.",Negative

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling.  This looks fancy but very old school.
Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating

Very confusing direction or procedure given.
I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers
When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products.
Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate when leaving from KL to overseas. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority.

As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go.

Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there.

"KLIA1 has undergone a number of upgrades in the past couple of years, particularly in terms of dining options on Level 5's Departure Hall (before security/immigration control) and duty-free shopping (after security/immigration control) in the main terminal. Work is still ongoing and hopefully we'll continue to see improvements in the months to come.

My main problem with KLIA1 is the absence of any water refill stations at the passenger waiting area (boarding gates) after security clearance. Being a frequent flyer who's flown in and out of so many airports around the world, KLIA1 remains the only big airport that doesn't have this facility made available to passengers. I don't understand why the airport just doesn't address this issue as it's causing passengers (e.g., parents, senior travellers, etc.) so much inconvenience.

Once passengers clears security, they won't access to any drinking water until they board their flight. Surely this is a shortcoming that can be easily fixed by the airport administrator...yet it remains the same month after month after month.

"Worst immigration experience in international airports compared to other major transit airports in Asia i.e  Dubai, Doha, Istanbul and Bangkok airports.

There was this lady at the counter. She took more than 30 mins on one couple! FGS either accept or reject. Very un progressional behavior by the immigration staff.

This long wait made me miss my visit to chocolate shops as only 20 mins were left after the immigration clears. Moreover, for international departures you have to take a bus to another lounge. Which is weird for such a developed country.

The shops inside are nice and many food options are available.

Mosque is available on 3rd level. Have to search for it or ask for directions from the staff.

I realized after I used the toilet, the flush isn't working. Out of clue I came out and try to reach out for assistance so other people don't get stuck in same faulty toilet .When I came out from toilet, I heard someone from my back calling me ""Oiiiiii"" No flushing toilet...ahh""...I turned around wonder who could be so rude like this, it was an Indian cleaner lady....super rude the way they treat the visitors in the airport, I have to explain to her that flush is not working in English couple of times before heading out from the toilet. So disappointing the way she sounded. I hope the management will adequate them a bit more professional to tourist people.Before travelling to Malaysia, we also stopped by in Thailand-Phuket for a week...I have to tell this that we had best hospitality in Phuket Airport and the their town. They are more polite and helpful, the atmosphere is so much cleaner then in Malaysia.",Negative

"I had two layovers at KLIA. The first time, everything went well: the airport was clean, well-organized, and especially a well-appointed prayer room, which is really appreciated by Muslim travelers.

However, the second time was a completely different story, as if it weren't even the same place. As soon as you get off the plane, nothing is clear: there's almost no signage for baggage claim. It's easy to get lost, you don't know where to go. And then, surprise: you have to go through security and immigration before claiming your baggage. Completely illogical. At least let me collect my bag peacefully first!

Once you're through immigration, you arrive in a huge crowd, with no smooth flow of traffic. Then you have to go through security again to get out. You board, you get off, you take a bus, you change buildings... frankly, a real hassle.

Another point: the baggage counter agents are extremely strict, sometimes even abusive. If you weigh 5 kg more than you need, you pay, period, no flexibility.

The prayer rooms? They used to be clean, now they're dilapidated, not maintained. Really a shame.

Finally, I had a three-hour layover, I barely had time to navigate the obstacle course to get to my gate. And guess what? 40 minutes into the flight, our gate was changed from 35 to 4. Great.

And then, as a Muslim, I felt uneasy. For a country I considered a brother, I had never felt so foreign. Clearly, Asian passengers are given priority. Sad to say, but I felt a real form of nationalism.

In short, very disappointed. I didn't find the welcome I was hoping for in a country like Malaysia.",Negative
The information about departure is confusing and unfriendly. Upon checking for which row is the airline from the information counter the staff just randomly gave the wrong information to a Malaysian airline counter rather than the SQ counter.

"Travel Tips for Kuala Lumpur: Save Money on Airport Transfers
Avoid Grab e-Hailing, Especially Advance Bookings

Grab drivers, particularly for advance bookings, may overcharge or provide subpar service. Instead, use Bolt for a more affordable and reliable ride.

Bypass Airport Surcharges with Trains
To avoid high airport ride-hailing fees, take the Express Rail Link (ERL) to Salak Tinggi station. From there, book a ride via Bolt for a significantly cheaper fare.

Steer Clear of Airport Taxis

Avoid taxis waiting at the airport, as they often charge exorbitant rates (RM300–400). Opt for e-hailing services like Bolt, where fares to Kuala Lumpur should not exceed RM80 for a standard car or RM50 for a 4-seater.
Know Your Rights with E-Hailing

With e-hailing apps, pay only the fare shown in the app. If a driver demands extra payment, record their details (name, car plate number, and interaction) and report it to the nearest police station. Such behavior violates fair practices and harms Malaysia’s reputation.

Pro Tip: Always book rides through trusted apps like Bolt for transparency and savings. Safe travels!",Negative

I came on AirAsia via HIS.

When I returned to Japan, I was constantly told to check in at the machine, and even when I went to the machine, I was asked for my reservation number.
However, the document from HIS does not have a reservation number written on it.
Therefore, even if you go to the counter again and say, ""You can't check in using the machine!"", they just insist that you ""check in using the machine.""

So when I looked back at my HIS documents, I found a form that was difficult to understand and required me to show the staff in English that I couldn't check in using the machine.

However, even if I showed them my English, the staff was insistent that I check in using the machine.

After that, I managed to check in, but...

Once waiting at the gate there was no toilets. You’d think an airport of this size would then put toilets at the gate ?

Extremely Disappointed – Misleading Prices and Poor Service

I had a very disappointing experience at this café in the Malaysian International Airport. The prices displayed on the product tags were already quite high, but when I went to pay, I was suddenly asked to pay more due to “additional taxes” that were not shown upfront. This kind of pricing is misleading and unfair, especially in an international airport where transparency should be standard.

To make matters worse, when I questioned the price difference, the staff refused to give me what I had selected unless I paid the extra hidden charges. I ended up leaving without my purchase.

Travelers deserve honesty, clear pricing, and respect—not surprises at the counter. I hope airport management takes this seriously and enforces proper pricing standards. I would not recommend this café to anyone.",Negative

"KLIA is so huge, the potential clinical coldness of the facility is cleverly softened with what appears to be an atrium of greenery.
The once state of the art facilities of this Airport is marred by the breakdown of the Aerotrain system that used to provide a world class service between the terminals.
The Aerotrain gates have been hidden behind dark but colourful hoarding. Opposite the hoarding are lines of waiting passengers queuing to enter the various B gates, together with their various hand carry items. With poor lighting due to the height of the dark colourd hoarding,  this creates a somewhat long dark narrow somber passage that arriving visitors to Malaysia must navigate to reach the escalators to the ground level and transfer bus terminal.
Any negative impressions arising from negotiating past the queuing passengers with unsettled infants and the ocassional unrestrained child darting into the crowd flow is further accentuated as one reaches the ground level and confronted by the multinational crowd chaos at the
Satellite Terminal bus transfer gate.
The airport employees manning the area do a great job in moving the crowd in arbitrary groups onto the waiting buses. Despite the apparent crowd chaos, these Malaysian employees at various informal ""gates"" manage to prevent a crowd surge and create controlled access on to the buses. These lowly front line employees are the true heroes in this situation and are living examples of the ""Malaysia Boleh"" can-do attitude.  It's such a pity senior Airport management doesn't display a similar level of commitment in getting the Aerotrain system fixed and creating a positive first impression for international arrivals to Malaysia.",Negative

1. Pointless arriving early because your gate isn’t available and you end up waiting on the tarmac without air conditioning. Not enough leeway between departing / arriving flights and no backup plan

2. You often arrive at the departures gate rather than arrivals and need to take a bus to arrivals / passport control, which is a waste of time. The new aerotrain has been out of action for over 2yrs with completion dates, unsurprisingly, being delayed several times.

3. If you haven’t already been severely frustrated by the first 2 points, wait till you arrive at passport control. Only 2 (max 3) of the booths are open and staff are slow, disinterested and have no desire to speed up the process, as though they revel in seeing their visitors suffer.

"I was assaulted by a female airport passenger experience officer who attempted to physically restrain me without justification. When I demanded to file a police report, I was told I would have to go to Terminal 2—something my Australian emergency passport did not permit. Despite my repeated requests, the airport police refused to take my report and instead escorted me to the immigration department.

There, I was met by an aggressive and unprofessional immigration officer named Kamarudin. When I asked for his full name in writing, he refused and rudely pointed to his name badge, telling me to take a photo with my phone. The moment I did, he became enraged and began intimidating me—even going so far as to take photos of me and my passport on his personal phone. This was a blatant violation of privacy and professional conduct.

**Malaysia’s airport authorities and immigration officers behaved in a disgusting, abusive, and unaccountable manner. Travelers beware: AVOID MALAYSIA at all costs!**

**Legal Analysis**
This conduct raises multiple violations under Malaysian law:

1. **Assault and Criminal Force (Penal Code Sections 350-352)**
The staff member's actions in grabbing my arms and physically restraining me without consent constitutes criminal force under Section 350. Case precedent (PP v. Mohd Anuar bin Abdullah [1994] 2 MLJ 261) confirms that any intentional use of force without lawful justification meets this threshold.

2. **Wrongful Confinement (Penal Code Section 340)**
The unlawful restriction of my movement within the clinic treatment room amounts to wrongful confinement. Malaysian jurisprudence establishes that detention without legal authority is punishable, particularly where no legitimate lien exists over the person.

3. **Official Misconduct**
The behavior of Immigration Officer Kamarudin in:
- Failing to properly address a criminal complaint
- Intimidating a complainant
- Improper use of personal devices to photograph sensitive documents
May constitute offenses under Malaysia's official misconduct provisions.

It took too long.
I'm sure it's the airline that's taking so long, but I think they should give it a bit more thought and improve it.

DANGER!!!
The absolute shame is the controls in front of the individual gates (no information about them beforehand). AFTER going through the duty free shop area, you will have to go through security checkpoints again and drink/throw away all of the liquids you purchased there. You even have to destroy the water you bought for the flight.

So instead we had to take the bus to another terminal, which obviously did not give us enough time to catch our flight, so we were stuck in KL for 1 night.

I forgot to send it, it was my fault, but they didn't let me go back to check in my luggage and confiscated it, kept it separately and didn't destroy it.
I felt like they deliberately wanted to take my things. I felt unhappy and no longer had sympathy.",Negative
"It will be the last airport on Earth you’d ever want to fly to or from. The gate numbers change constantly, often right before the designated boarding time.

Before you board, you’re forced to toss your water with no option to refill, leaving you reliant on the airplane for hydration. The train link between the main terminal and the satellite has been out of service for years. The security line before the gate is a complete joke and a massive waste of time. It’s truly the most dreadful airport on Earth, and it pales in comparison to world-class airports like Changi or even Suvarnabhumi.",Negative
"A terrible place. We flew here at night for the first time. Filling out the online form—we didn't like either the number or the email address—took half an hour. Even in the relatively empty airport, we had problems. The electronic barrier wouldn't let Russian passports through, for some unknown reason, so much so that even the staff didn't know how to help.
We ended up staying at a regular hotel where the staff were sleeping. Then we searched for a hotel right next to the airport. We ended up sleeping there for five hours out of the planned eight because checkout was at 10:00 AM.
We arrived back during the day. The staff offered to complete the electronic history check, but the check-in line was insane, an hour and a half long, and very few windows for migrants were open.",Negative

"It ok but the a huge issue I saw we fly from Kuala Lumpur to Manila.  At the ticket counter there were only (4) points to check in your baggage. We waited close to 30 mins. Then you went through an immigration security check point.  You waited another 20 mins.

Then you were bused to an other building then you walked to the gate.  At the gate you went through another security checkpoint, where I had to drank my water I just purchased, removed my watch.  After this checkpoint I just wanted to charge my phone for the Grab ride back to the condo, could not bring water on the plane.

No restroom in that area after the checkpoint.

"Worst immigration experience in international airports compared to other major transit airports in Asia i.e  Dubai, Doha, Istanbul and Bangkok airports.

Immigration in the country took more than 1.5 hours and system was down so they had to do manual entries.

On the way back. Immigration took more than 2 hours. I had to request few people to let go of their turn so that I don't miss my flight. Only one counter for a queue of about 50 people(Normally takes 30 mins at other airports, however, the Malaysia made sure 50 people took 2 hours). There was this lady at the counter. She took more than 30 mins on one couple! FGS either accept or reject. Very un progressional behavior by the immigration staff.

This long wait made me miss my visit to chocolate shops as only 20 mins were left after the immigration clears. Moreover, for international departures you have to take a bus to another lounge. Which is weird for such a developed country.

The shops inside are nice and many food options are available.

Mosque is available on 3rd level. Have to search for it or ask for directions from the staff.

If some one wishes to connect a domestic flight directly with the international keep at least 3 hours buffer. Always book within the same literary.

Keep at least 2 hours for the immigration clearance. Such a pathetic and slow service. Even countries such as Pakistan and KSA have better immigration services.

"KLIA is an international airport that always feels like a poor budget airport that is falling apart. Ironically, it is overstaffed by an army of smiling greeters.

On Sunday, 22 June 2025, we saw water dispenser stations broken and unrepaired. ""Free drinks"" stations abandoned, unmanned.

The only smoking room in the airport is a filthy room covered in black soot: incredibly smelly, no ventilation systems, piles of ash, trash, and butts all over. Warning: Enter at your own risk.

The aerotrain was being repaired, and although bus services were provided, no signs were available to passengers on where it is. Bus services from the sub terminal to the main terminal were not easy to find.

Tragically, the contrast between KLIA and KLIA2 (the latter an actual budget terminal that's well designed, modern, clean, and efficient) has never been clearer.

If KLIA2 is a Budget airport, then KLIA should be called a ""No Budget"" Airport.",Negative

"The customer service are horrible here. I know you guys don’t speak English because that’s not your first English but it’s so rude the way you guys talked to me. I have got a bad experience with this airport and Malaysia airline. Hi, I’d like to complain about the experience today with Malaysia Airlines. I was so angry at the flight attendant so here is the complaint I sent to the Malaysia Airlines.

I took the airplane from Malaysia to Auckland on July 8th. I have been getting bad service even I was at the airport in Malaysia. People who work here are so rude and they don’t know how they talk with customers. I was on the airplane, there was no toilet paper in two bathrooms so I went to the back to use another bathroom. I didn’t know where it was so I was looking for it and a flight attendant who named Rasher or something was being rude to me. I asked a man flight attendant what her name is. He was nine at least. So what happened is that when I was looking for the bathroom, she goes the bathroom is here with a disgusted look while she was on the phone even I didn’t ask her anything. I was just looking. So I let her know there is no toilet paper in two bathrooms that I went to because she started talking to me even she was on the phone so I said to her nicely. And She said it’s in the middle. I was like what the hell is she talking about and that’s your job to fill it up. Or she doesn’t know that’s her job lol The manager who said is in charge came to me and asked me what happened and she apologised me but the manager was asking me the flight attendant who was rude to me was on the phone right? I’m like okay if she was on the phone, is she allowed to be rude to customers? Does that what she meant? And the rude one started talking to me in the first place not me. She could also say I would not mind to answer it after on the phone or not. Maybe she doesn’t have a brain to make a grammar in English so she just said in the middle which I don’t know what she meant. And then the rude one came to me to say sorry and she was trying to use she was on the phone as a excuse and she said oh she thought I started talking to her first bra bra bra which is not true. I felt she was trying to find some excuse to make her self look better in the situation. I could see that she doesn’t feel sorry she was doing that because there was a manager next to her so I said I don’t need apology from you because you already made me comfortable and it’s too late to apologise. When I said to her you were just doing this because your manager was next to you and she said okay. This kind of person would keep doing the same mistake because her apology doesn’t mean anything to her. I’ve never had a bad experience like this anywhere on airplanes. Malaysia Airline is horrible. Isn’t that Malaysia Airlines that lost the airplane and people who were on the airplane are not found? That explains why you guys treat customers like that and do horrible customer service! Wish I didn’t use Malaysia airline so I didn’t have to come here to transfer…. I would never come to Malaysia again anyway!",Negative
"Flight at 705am, we were ask to cross the checkpoint into immigration by 605am. We were 5 mins late, denied enterence, got ping pong around different department for 30mins. Ultimately it was the information counter that seems to know what to do, got into contact with the airline, but it was too late because of the time wasted by the ground crew that doesn't seems to know where to direct us.

Airline ground crew are locals, seemed oblivious and gave us the not my problem attitude.

Later we went to the airline office to check on how to retrieve our baggage, the staff's attitude was so poor with all the lecturing when we had been running around for 45mins and are in distress. Yes it was our fault for being 5mins late, she could had shown some empathy in her choice if words even though there's nothing she could had done.

That's the reality of Malaysian hospitality. 1st class on the surface, 3rd world attitude and mentality. I've seem way more polite and helpful staff in China and Singapore.",Negative

When departing, some boarding gates don’t have restrooms. If you are assigned to such a gate, you have to go through a security check every time you go to the restroom.

"It's the capital airport of a big country ㅠ
It's hot because they turned on the air conditioner.
The bathroom is dirty because it's a toilet like a regular restaurant bathroom~

Despite being a large airport with a lot of transfers, there aren't enough chairs to rest and wait, and there are only paid massage chairs! And there's a lot of shopping. Malaysia is a beggar who's become rich~
Of course, the price is expensive, and even that's almost nonexistent after security.
Smokers, you must stop by the smoking room before security. If you go all the way to the corner before the P and Q gates, you'll find the smoking room.
After security, it's crowded with people waiting~ It's hard to find a chair~ The structure and area are very stuffy, and it's hard to find any amenities.

Air Asia staff claimed that out luggage was damaged from ""rough handling"" - NONSENSE! I think they are part of a criminal group stealing passenger belonging and minimising our complaints.

"I had the worst experience in this airport for travelling.  This looks fancy but very old school.
Restaurant not enough air con at night time. Sweating when eating

Very confusing direction or procedure given.
I was required to transferred here from overseas to KKIA (domestic) i was not required to take my lugguage while I gone through the customs here. Then walked all the way from international to domestic from the international building. But then I was required to ""enter"" the Malaysia border again while I was in KKIA (I took domestic) with my checked in luggage and scanning my index fingers
When i went back from KK to KL, I only required to go thru the custom once at KKIA. I was expecting to go thru the domestic building so I can get some local products.
Then my hand luggage was required to go thru x ray just at the gate when leaving from KL to overseas. My flask was full of water. But it was not required to empty out. And no airline staff at the gate just b4 boarding to check the boarding priority.
Airline still tier off the ticket manually.

As I thought I can walk thru, so I followed the sign. I realised I couldn't walk thru after 5 mins later. Then I walked back and realised the sign was directed incorrectly neat gate G section. One pointing left and the other sign pointed right. I saw few customers including aircrew staff were confused and didn't know which way to go.

Further, the staff was staring at me while was brusing teeth at the washroom at 6am. I realised she's waiting to clean my spot after I finished brushing. She either come back rather than just staring at me. I felt so unconfmy and I was the only passenger there.

"Drinking water is a major issue at the airport and there are several reviews mentioning this but nothing has changed. You are not allowed to take your water beyond security which is understandable but how can you not have water filling stations or even bottled water for people waiting to board? It's quite disappointing and shocking, and can be a big issue especially for elderly passengers and those with health issues. In a hot and humid climate, access to drinking water is essential. Unfortunately, there are no water refill stations or bottled water available after security.

If there is a flight delay, passengers are left waiting for hours without water. I've been to several airports and never had this issue, just look at Singapore airport where there are water refill facilities everywhere.

Upon arrival, we were met with confusing procedures and zero proper guidance on how to complete the entry process. The “Arrive” app they require is completely unnecessary, buggy, and slows everything down. There was no one clearly assigned to assist passengers, and the process made no sense.

To make matters worse, we approached a uniformed police officer for help, who rudely dismissed us and refused to offer any kind of support. His tone was aggressive, unprofessional, and completely inappropriate for someone representing airport security. Instead of helping travelers—many of whom were clearly confused and exhausted—he seemed more interested in scolding people.

If you are in a hurry, you will be frustrated to find the way. The difficulty level is probably hellish on a scale of 1-10.",Negative
"Why is KLIA becoming more unreasonable now..??

Why is it necessary to remove the existing chairs..??

Is it because you're afraid that homeless people will sit there..??

What about the disabled,the elderly and other people who are tired and want to sit down..??

Is it necessary to waste time and energy going all the way to that very far away observation tower..??

Think about it,there's no need to be so selfish that you cause trouble for others..

We have the right to sit in those chairs,
immediately place the chairs in all the places they should be placed..

"One of the worst in handling passengers. The concept of having security check in the enterance of gate is a biggest mistake. Only one scanner for more than 200 passengers, very less staffs. No proper water facility inside the airport. Most of the water dispensers were not in working conditions nor giving low water alarm. Security checkin is close to the gate, they don't allow water bottle inside. In the gate waiting area no facility for water. If the flight gets delayed everyone need to wait for a cup of water till get boarded.",Negative
"Not a fan of this airport. There were very few and separated charging ports throughout the facility and limited and spread out sitting for gates, at least until the 5 minutes before boarding where it opened into an ample space.

I missed my flight because of severe logistic issues. Had to stay is all night at the airport to catch h the next flight. No flights schedule displayed at  terminal H10 . It was like a ghost town.

"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?!

First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. I’ve traveled through many large airports, but I’ve never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that… but what came next was even worse.

After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub.

We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (we’re used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle.

Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we weren’t allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, because it's too late now to buy tickets (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel.

In the end, we paid over double the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there.

Oh and did I mention that the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration? I had such a hard time to book the Grab and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, because there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!!

This airport is a logistical mess and a terrible first impression of Malaysia. I've never thought an airport would affect my will to visit a country but here we are.",Negative
All seats should have a charging port.,Negative
"Be careful of the taxi dispatchers on the arrival floor of Terminal 2 who look like they have permission to drive because they have name tags hanging from their hands.

"RTS agents representing Air Asia really screwed us up in KLIA 2. We were sent on a wild goose chase to drop our bags to three different locations. At the end, the lady decided to close her counter arbitrarily after folks have been waiting in line for a long time. Her only reason “I want to get out of this counter!”. I begged her saying you are guest services, you have to help us! I had a flight that leaves in 40 mins. She begrudgingly helped me with attitude. Probably never coming back to Malaysia with these experiences.

Furthermore, departure for KLIA 2 had shopping malls and restaurants at its entrance. This made it difficult to get to our check in counter and to our gate ultimately. The poor design was absurd and contrary to airports worldwide, making it a frustrating experience for travellers.

To make things worse, I got food poisoning from the nasi kandar food court.",Negative

"Dear traveler, do NOT use ""taxi"" that waiting at the airport. They ""offer"" you a ride for rm300-400. You should only get a ride via ehailing service, I recommended BOLT. A ride from airport to Kuala Lumpur should not exceed RM80, MAX. If a 4 seats it RM50 MAX. If you book an ehailing, driver can't ask more money from you. Pay what in the app. If driver ask for more money, record them & car number plate, and go to police station to submit a report. Those driver who doesn't use the app / ask for more money is the betrayal to Malaysia.",Negative

"One of the worst airports in the world. The airlines and the airport will not inform if they change boarding gate. They tell you fight delayed and so you wait at the gate.

You continue to wait at the original boarding gate until the flight leaves from the changed boarding gate. Leaving you stranded.

Updated 28th Feb.

"Arriving:
Immigration for arrivals took too long! The officers works so slowly and the poor internet connection in this area is not helping either. It took us long enough to complete immigration to the point that our bags were no longer in the conveyor belt/shown on screen. Pick up location of ride hailing (Grab) was easy at Level 1.

Departure:
Check in counters are spread out making it not too crowded/congested. Immigration for departure is quicker and easier. However, there's a security screening for customs departure that was separated with at-gate security check. I would say this is very inefficient as you need to check your bags twice and once you have cleared security you practically cannot go out to the retail area. This also lead to congestion during Gate Open as people would avoid coming to it and come as late as possible.

Security at the gate is so slow. In addition, the post-security gate is a nightmare with neither water stations nor proper toilet! There seems to be no signs of priority boarding based on group but rather by seats (not sure if this is an MH or KLIA problem). Retail space is decent with great tax-free goods options and decent restaurant selections. One thing to appreciate: the toilets (in retail & public) areas are clean and equipped with jet showers.",Negative

"I had an extremely frustrating experience with the immigration process at this airport. The service was painfully slow, with long queues that seemed to move at a snail’s pace despite there being multiple counters. It felt disorganized and inefficient from the moment I arrived.

What made it worse was the attitude of some of the immigration officers. Several of them appeared moody and unapproachable, offering no guidance or courtesy. Instead of helping travelers—many of whom were confused or exhausted—they seemed irritated and dismissive. I understand their job isn’t easy, but a basic level of respect and professionalism should still be expected.

This kind of experience leaves a very poor impression, especially for international visitors. I hope the airport authorities seriously look into improving the staffing, training, and overall management of the immigration area. Travelers deserve better.",Negative

"Extremely Poor Accessibility & Lack of Compassion

I brought my elderly grandmother—who requires a wheelchair and has dementia—to the airport, and the accessibility experience was appalling.

When I approached the front desk to request a wheelchair, I was told to go all the way to the check-in area at the end of the terminal first. How is someone supposed to leave a person with dementia alone while they go fetch a wheelchair? We had no choice but to walk the entire distance, which completely defeats the purpose of offering assistance in the first place.

To make matters worse, the check-in counter we needed was right at the end of the row. If my grandmother had truly been immobile, she would’ve had no way to reach that point on her own. Imagine if she were a solo disabled traveller—what would have happened then?

Even more disappointing was the staff attitude. There were six front counter staff chatting among themselves, not a single smile, not a trace of compassion or initiative. It felt like basic empathy and responsibility were missing entirely. Accessibility should not be an afterthought, and neither should kindness.",Negative

Many Malays receive English education from elementary school but still can't speak English properly! How does that work? To be honest, it felt like the staff were completely uninterested in their job, and some even seemed to resent being there. If you don't want to be bullied, shouted at or ignored when asking questions during an already stressful flight trip, then avoid this airport at all cost!

I was here on a 3 hour transit trip and within a span of those hours the amount of bullying and incompetence I observed was horrifying. Trust me this airport doesn't discriminate, nearly everyone of all nationalities and ethnicities feel the brunt of their hostility. Also, within 3 hours, the gate changed like 6 times! I have been to many major airports before, never faced something like this.

What really stood out was the slogan displayed upon arrival: “We hope you’ve enjoyed our Malaysian Hospitality.” Frankly, this felt more like an empty promise than a reflection of the experience I had. A service should speak for itself, but in this case, it was clear that overcompensating with slogans only highlights the gap between what is advertised and what is actually delivered.

Given this experience, I will never visit Malaysia again and I certainly won't be encouraging my friends or family to visit. Avoid countries that do not respect and appreciate tourist coming to help their economy!",Negative

During arrival we wanted to switch from C Gates to A/B gates for domestic departure but it was confusing to find the directions.

Exactly at the same location, during departure, we had to switch to C gates but got confused. We later realised that one of the sign boards is actually wrong. It points to an escalator upwards that goes into the shopping area. Whereas the C gates entry is exactly in the opposite direction of the sign. For an international airport this is not acceptable at all. I dont have photos, but getting confused at the same place two times is not right. We saw a few others get confused too.

Apart from that there is no major security check and body scan before immigration. However this is done prior to boarding. This is not as per standard processes elsewhere wherein the detailed security check and body scan is done immediately at entry.

I missed my flight because of severe logistic issues. Had to stay is all night at the airport to catch h the next flight. No flights schedule displayed at  terminal H10 . It was like a ghost town.

KLIA2 very badly designed airport where u have to walk 20 mins to get from gate to immigration check point. No trolleys supplied to help carry heavy packs especially when children are involved. No porters or even signs pointing the right direction to immigration.,Negative
Not even worth one star. The moment you enter the country you’ll get scolded by the immigration for coming to the counter together with your partner even though there are plenty of people do the same in other counters. So if you get a shitty officer they will ruin your trip. Imagine you get screamed at once you land in the country that you are going to spend your money in! The worst airport I’ve ever been to out of so many countries I’ve travelled to. What a terrible first impression! Grow up Malaysia 👍🏻. We are not illegal immigrants.,Negative
"I’ve traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always stood out for its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, is a beautiful highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of foreign and unique local offerings.

With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where it’s due- the new bathrooms are a massive improvement! Well-designed, clean, and dry. But I can’t ignore the disappointing shift in retail and dining options. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. Also why is alcohol and tobacco taking up a large portion of the retail space every time? I was shocked to find only one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a foodie haven—why isn’t KLIA showcasing its rich culinary heritage and diversity? This seem to now be engulfed by the blandness of foreign cafe franchises, croissants and cakes. Would be delightful to have more local options!

Gone are the great local options that once served authentic dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles and teh tarik. Instead, global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jean’s dominate the F&B spaces. Surely, there’s room for more homegrown eateries that represent Malaysia’s incredible food culture?

To add to the frustration, the monorail is still not working, and travelers have to rely on shuttle buses- slow and less efficient. And when I asked an ‘Ask Me For Help’ staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone—customer service should be better than this.

KLIA, we can do better! Support local businesses and bring back the true Malaysian experience.",Negative

What’s the point of filling out the online arrival form if immigration officers still spend 4-7 minutes on each tourist?
After standing in line for over 1.5 hours and watching how the officers worked, we were left very disappointed. Even worse was how immigration officers treated Asian travelers with darker skin - their gestures were so disrespectful, it was truly unpleasant to witness.",Negative

"I am writing to provide feedback on my recent experience flying to KLIA via Singapore Airlines.

While I generally appreciate the quality of service on Singapore Airlines flights, I was disappointed with the airport experience at KLIA, especially considering this was not a budget flight.

Although the airport was large and packed with lots of shops and eateries, there are areas that could be improved to facilitate smoother transit for arriving/departure passengers. Personally, I wasn’t expecting to go through the hassle of having to transit from the plane to the arrival hall, taking into consideration that this was a direct flight.

Upon arrival, after disembarking from the plane, we were directed by a staff member, who was shouting, to proceed to Cxx for a transfer to the arrival hall. This information could easily be missed if people are talking or focused on finding the nearest toilet. I tried to console myself, thinking that perhaps our flight was scheduled to park in a “further” lot due to multiple flights arriving around the same time.​
Anyway, just go with the flow and follow those in front since we are told to ....

​Would suggest the following improvements:

* Rather than having a staff member shout instructions, ​ you can consider placing clear, large signage on both sides of the walkway as passengers disembark.
* Provide more readily available information upon flight arrival​ / departure.
* Consider adjusting the volume of the announcement speaker with loud and clear information in English, Chinese, and Malay.

Clear directional signs and information would make a big difference for first-time visitors like myself and would save a lot of time​ especially when you have so many incoming/outgoing flights day to day.....

The signage for the bus transfer was unclear, and it took approximately 4-5 minutes to find the waiting point to queue for the feeder bus to the arrival hall.

Upon arriving at the arrival hall, it was another 2-minute walk to reach immigration. The area was extremely crowded, with queues of 2-3 lines in a row, resulting in an hour-long wait to clear immigration.

The process was very disorganized and messy, with no one managing the human traffic, possibly due to a shortage of manpower.
Although the officers were friendly and efficient in clearing the queue, it would be beneficial to have crowd control/security to guide and manage the flow of passengers.

Locating the correct baggage belt after clearing immigration was another challenge. The area was crowded, and there were only three to four luggage belts, requiring passengers to walk near the belt to check the monitor screen.
This was frustrating, especially with different groups of people surrounding the area, some looking for directions, some waiting for friends, and others searching for the right belt.
We eventually found our luggage placed not far away from the luggage belt area near the exit, with a sign displaying the SQ Airlines logo on the floor. Many unclaimed bags from our flight were present, as most passengers were still stuck in immigration.

The entire process, from disembarking the plane to retrieving our luggage outside the baggage claim area, was challenging.

I thought we were only required to transit to the arrival hall as a one-time occurrence. However, on our return flight, we were once again required to take a short bus to the departure hall.
Furthermore, there were no water dispensers available after passing through the inspection gate, which was inconvenient.

As a tourist, the airport gives the first impression for passengers, and its organization is crucial.

I hope this feedback will be taken into consideration for future improvements",Negative
"There's no Wi-Fi in the airport. You'll have to pay a lot for a drink in a restaurant to use the restaurant's Wi-Fi. This is very inconvenient when your layover lasts for hours.
The few electrical outlets available aren't international...
Be careful in the restrooms too. The water coming out of the taps has more pressure than a fire hose.",Negative
Security guard named Ahmad should be fired immediately for acting immature and just straight up yelling at everybody without knowing his manners. The rest of the airport is good though,Negative
"Beware of Batik Airlines, who flys out of this airport. They are an absolute scam, and conduct predatory behavior at the gate. I was shaken down for nearly 600 dollars worth of fees. On a multi leg trip, I had 0 issues; then Batik found every single excuse they could to squeeze money from me, at the gate, at the checkin, and during the flight.

I honestly don't know how these people sleep at night with such predatory behavior, and I'm surprised a respectable airport like KUL allows them to run thier racket out of this airport. What a disgrace.",Negative
"I’ve traveled through KLIA countless times, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading.

With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where it’s due—the new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well-designed, clean, and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail space—why so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradise—why isn’t KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign café chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti?

Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jean’s. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysia’s rich culinary diversity?- take a page out of Jakarta or Singapore airport.

To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (I’ve lost count how long I’ve waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an ‘Ask Me For Help’ staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone. Customer service should be better than this!

KLIA, let’s do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers.

P.S. if you’re ever at the Satellite building of KLIA terminal 1, I highly recommend checking out the Jungle Boardwalk 😄 I always look forward to visiting it if my Gate is located there. 🌴🌳🌴",Negative

We were stuck in the line with the human linemen when we went through customs, so we had to wait in the line again when we returned home. Unfortunately, the human linemen were incredibly slow and inattentive, so the wait was incredibly long. So, we had to go through the machine at customs.

It was also very crowded when we went inside to eat. I thought fast food would be faster, but the line at Burger King, ordering and picking up, can take an hour. It's not even fast food!? In the end, we didn't have time to eat and had to take it to go. There wasn't a single store in the airport that we could explore.

The inspection process here is also very unique. You can bring water through the first checkpoint, but you have to go through the X-ray machine again before boarding the plane. You can't bring water this time. You're directly on the plane. There's no place to fill up your water or use the vending machines. My throat was really sore before the in-flight meal arrived.

If you want to enjoy a leisurely stroll and eat, it's recommended to arrive 3-5 hours early. We arrived 3 hours early and were still in such a mess.",Negative

Horrendous and frightening journey for single females to negotiate to. At least LCCT has Car rental booths actually in the terminal at arrivals.

Update January 2023 and nothing has improved about KLIA 1.
The car rental office area is nothing short of a discusting, hot & humid, car fume filled enclosed area. Staffed by people who need to be motivated away from their phones to serve you.
That just completes the whole slow, painful experience of a dark and miserable KLIA and a sorry welcome to Malaysia.
A national disgrace that needs to be addressed from the miserable gate staff, immigration & customs officials, to the customer facing staff throughout.

In addition, Etihad only provides a few mini glasses of water during its 7-hour flight, and there is no possibility of buying a bottle on the plane either. We were on a flight without air conditioning and without a bottle of water with the plane on the ground for 2 hours due to a technical problem followed by 7 hours of flight with only a few glasses of water to keep going.

All the main restaurants and cafés are before the 2nd security check. This is ridiculously user unfriendly. Airport is huge but not pretty. Very well connected though with the KLIA Express train,Negative
"I’ve traveled through KLIA countless times, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, smooth check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, inspired by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, remains a stunning highlight. But what truly made KLIA special was its balance of international and uniquely local offerings- something that now seems to be fading.

With the recent KLIA1 renovation, I have to give credit where it’s due- the new bathrooms are a huge improvement! Well designed, good ventilation, clean and dry. But the retail and dining experience has taken a disappointing turn. Many local options have disappeared, replaced by foreign goods. And once again, alcohol and tobacco seem to dominate the retail space—why so much of it? I was shocked to find just one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal 1. Malaysia is a food paradise—why isn’t KLIA celebrating this? Instead, the vibrancy of local flavors is being replaced by the bland sameness of foreign coffe chains, croissants, and cakes. More AUTHENTIC local options would be a delight!- especially for those leaving home and craving one last nasi lemak or kuey teow or teh tarik or curried roti?

Once, travelers could enjoy authentic Malaysian dishes like kaya toast, prawn noodles, and teh tarik. Now, the F&B scene is overrun by global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jean’s. Surely, KLIA can do better by making space for homegrown eateries that showcase Malaysia’s rich culinary diversity?- take a page out of Jakarta or Singapore airport.

To add to the frustration, the monorail is still out of service (I’ve lost count how long I’ve waited), forcing travelers to rely on slow and inefficient shuttle buses. And when I asked an ‘Ask Me For Help’ staff member for food recommendations, she barely looked up from her phone as she was too busy texting her friend to care. Customer service should be better than this!

KLIA, let’s do better! Support local businesses and bring back the authentic Malaysian experience to travellers.

P.S. if you’re ever at the Satellite building of KLIA terminal 1 (after the shuttle service), I highly recommend visiting the Jungle Boardwalk - a small beautiful green forest in the middle of the building 😄 I always look forward to visiting it if my Gate is located there. 🌴🌳🌴",Negative
"No vegetarian options in most places and no where served non-dairy milk options. This seems quite outdated to me considering how many people don’t eat meat or drink dairy. I am lactose intolerant.

You go through security once and think you’re good to go, so we bought food and water for the flight, as we were next to our gate. We then proceeded to enter our gate to be told we weren’t allowed water or food through. This was quite annoying considering we had just spent money on them and had already gone through the main security. We then entered the gate and realised there was no water given and no toilets. We had over an hour wait for a flight. I don’t understand the point of this?",Negative
They make you check in at one terminal only to have you board the plane at another. They make you throw away your bottle of water at the boarding gate and make you wait for over an hour before boarding the plane without access to water or toilets. A very uncomfortable situation.,Negative

Security check at the very end. The final waiting room doesn't even have access to a toilet. I don't understand why they don't have the security check earlier like most other airports. You either have to wait bc you cannot open the sealed plastic bag with water or you have to throw it away after you opened it.,Negative
"There are many things to improve at this airport.

There are twice as many security checks, passport checks, and boarding passes as at a Western airport. Just to give an example, the security process (where they check your water and all that) is right in front of the boarding gate.

This means that once you've passed through security, you can't buy anything, including the toilet, water, etc.

Aside from the inconvenience for travelers, it means underutilization of the machines for the airport, because they're only used when there's a flight at that gate, and fewer sales opportunities, because you're confined to that room for at least an hour and a half before the flight departs, waiting to actually board.

They have a lot to learn from their neighbors in Singapore, a little further south.",Negative
"This airport made me never want to come back to Malaysia. Who designed this place?!

First, the walk from the plane to immigration and baggage claim was unbelievably long. I’ve traveled through many large airports, but I’ve never had to walk this much just to reach my luggage. I could overlook that… but what came next was even worse.

After collecting our bags and passing immigration, we were forced to walk through (GET THIS!) A MALL to get to the exit. Yes, a literal mall where every airport in the world you'd be checking your transportation to finally leave. After a long flight, the last thing anyone wants is to be dragged through a maze of stores just to leave the airport. It felt like a cash grab, not a travel hub.

We finally made it out and were relieved to see Grab was available (we’re used to it from Thailand). But when we booked a ride, the wait time was 35 minutes! There was a huge, overcrowded Grab waiting area with screens showing incoming car plates, clearly, demand was way beyond what the airport could handle.

Tired and frustrated, we gave up on Grab, hoping to catch a bus instead. But we weren’t allowed to buy tickets until exactly 12 AM, which was also the listed departure time of the bus, ""because it's too late now to buy tickets"" (15 minutes ahead). We were told the bus would leave even after 12. The whole thing felt disorganized and unclear and the wait time seemed same as the Grab and the destination station is not even close to the hotel.

In the end, we paid almost triple the Grab fare to take a regular taxi, just to get the hell out of there.

Oh and did I mention that the airport wifi is not available once you finish immigration? I had such a hard time to book the Grab and check information and chat with my airbnb host because there was no wifi after immigration, because there's a freakin' mall between the airport and the exits!!!

"I'm giving it 1 star for the following reasons:
T1-> the security check only takes place immediately before boarding. This means that if you buy drinks before then (which you take with you on long-haul flights), you have to return them! Which is completely pointless! Furthermore, there's nothing to eat after baggage drop-off and passport control (which you want to get through as quickly as possible). Furthermore, there are no restrooms after the security check, so you'll wait about an hour for boarding plus a good 45 minutes until you're in the air to use a restroom... I've never seen anything like it, and I've been to many countries/continents.",Negative

"Edit: upon arrival as of June 2025, they removed auto entry now for foreign passports and only locals can go through them- what a waste of automated gates!

KLIA is a massive airport, but as of December 2024, it’s still undergoing some upgrading works, so not everything is fully operational (has been going on for the past year). Shops and dining options are still quite limited despite the airport's large size, which is a bit disappointing for travelers looking to explore or relax before their flights.

On the positive side, for certain passport holders, the biometric scanning at immigration makes the process quick and efficient, which is a welcome convenience. However, the baggage scanning process remains tedious—you’re required to scan your bags multiple times, such as when entering immigration and again when heading to your gate. Personally, this feels unnecessarily repetitive, but there’s little travelers can do about it.

Overall, KLIA has potential, and hopefully, the ongoing upgrades will bring noticeable improvements to both the facilities and passenger experience in the near future.",Neutral

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Malaysia is a major aviation hub known for its modern infrastructure and significant passenger capacity. It features two main terminals: KLIA1 (Main Terminal) for full-service airlines and KLIA2, which is the world’s largest terminal dedicated to low-cost carriers. Both terminals provide extensive amenities such as check-in counters, retail outlets, duty-free shops, lounges, and a range of dining options.
Despite its impressive size and facilities, passenger experiences at KLIA show a mixed picture. Some travelers appreciate the airport’s efficiency, particularly with business class services that offer quick access to lounges and smooth security checks. The connectivity is good, with efficient transportation options like the KLIA Ekspres train linking the airport to Kuala Lumpur city center in under 30 minutes, plus taxis and buses are readily available.
However, there are notable complaints that affect the overall impression. Passengers frequently cite poor staff behavior, long queues, and confusion during boarding and baggage checks, often describing staff as unfriendly or inattentive. Some criticize the immigration process, mentioning inconvenient requirements and poor assistance, especially for transit passengers. Food and beverage options, particularly in KLIA2, have received negative reviews for being limited, expensive, or insufficient for the passenger volume. Seating areas can be inadequate during peak times, and the indoor climate control sometimes falls short, making waiting uncomfortable.
In terms of infrastructure, KLIA offers modern and clean facilities, with well-organized terminals and a spacious layout. The addition of automated train systems within KLIA1 and a skybridge in KLIA2 has improved passenger movement. The airport continues to be recognized for service quality by industry bodies, but in practice, staff performance and customer service remain areas needing improvement.
Overall, KLIA is a modern and strategically important airport that provides extensive amenities and connectivity but is let down by inconsistent service quality and operational challenges that impact traveler satisfaction.Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Malaysia is a major and modern airport serving millions yearly, with two main terminals: KLIA1 for full-service airlines and KLIA2 dedicated to budget carriers. Both terminals feature extensive amenities including retail outlets, duty-free shops, lounges, and various dining options, supported by advanced infrastructure like automated trains and skybridges for smooth passenger transfers.
While the airport excels in its size, facilities, and connectivity—offering quick transportation options like the KLIA Ekspres train to Kuala Lumpur—it has garnered mixed overall reviews from travelers. Many praise KLIA1 for efficient and smooth security and boarding processes, especially for business class passengers. However, there are widespread complaints about staff attitude, with reports of unfriendly and inattentive personnel, chaotic queues, and confusing procedures that dampen the experience.
Other common issues include limited food and beverage options, especially in KLIA2, overcrowded seating areas, and inconsistent indoor climate control, making waiting uncomfortable during peak times. Some travelers also find the immigration and transfer processes cumbersome, with poor assistance and odd paperwork requirements for transit passengers.
Despite these challenges, KLIA maintains a clean and modern terminal environment with generally well-maintained facilities. It has received industry awards for its infrastructure and immigration service, but passenger experiences suggest that improving customer service and operational management is needed to match the airport’s world-class status.
In summary, KLIA offers comprehensive facilities and good connectivity as Malaysia’s primary international gateway but is hampered by service inconsistencies and operational issues that impact passenger satisfaction.",Neutral

Plenty of food places and the souvenir shops sold items at good prices. They were of course higher than at shops, but for an airport, they were good.
The baggage drop for British airways took a very long time. If flying with Malaysian airways and some other Asian airlines, there was practically no queue as it was self service.
Then there was immigration, which opened up to more shops. After immigration, the bags were kind of scanned, but this wasn't security. This then opens up to more shops and restaurants. Only 1 out of the 4 water fountains worked at this point and the water was only for consumption in this area, because you then pass through security when the gate opens.

"Airport Terminal 1 boasts modern upgrades to its luggage drop, check-in, immigration processes, and overall size. It is located approximately 60 minutes from Kuala Lumpur by car, or a quicker 45-minute journey via express train. ✈️🚄

However, there are a few areas for potential improvement. 🤔

1. Currently, there is a lack of a dedicated food court. While some cafes and pantries offer refreshments, the options are limited to cold food, and the only Burger King and other food options are situated at Gate C, inconveniently distant from other gates. 🍔🍟🙁 The travel time to Gate C from other gates is 15 minutes one-way by bus.

2. Seating is somewhat limited. 🪑💺

3. Entertainment options for children and families could be expanded. 🧸🎮🎈

4. The washrooms could be enhanced by providing tissue paper in the hand-wash areas. 🧻🧼🚰

5. Duty-free prices may be considered slightly higher than in some other countries. 💲⬆️

KUL acts as the main hub into Malaysia, and especially Kuala Lumpur. The smaller Subang airport is mostly used for regional or domestic flights.

Plenty of food places and the souvenir shops sold items at good prices. They were of course higher than at shops, but for an airport, they were good.
The baggage drop for British airways took a very long time. If flying with Malaysian airways and some other Asian airlines, there was practically no queue as it was self service.
Then there was immigration, which opened up to more shops. After immigration, the bags were kind of scanned, but this wasn't security. This then opens up to more shops and restaurants. Only 1 out of the 4 water fountains worked at this point and the water was only for consumption in this area, because you then pass through security when the gate opens.

"The airport is very large. Arrivals on a Tuesday evening were relatively smooth. Famous restaurants like Hua Yang and Hai Jiao Ren are located at the airport. I highly recommend checking them out first, as the lines at restaurants downtown are incredibly long. Departures on Saturday morning were a bit more chaotic, with incredibly crowded people and numerous check-in counters. They weren't divided by flight. From previous travel experience, children can't check in at the check-in counter. So, initially, we kept looking for a human check-in counter. We asked three staff members, each with a different explanation. This wasted a lot of time. It just so happened that our flight was delayed by an hour, otherwise we might have missed it. The restaurant in the airport lobby was incredibly crowded. After finally getting a table, it took another 30 minutes. We later discovered there were still many shops and restaurants after customs. Furthermore, baggage screening at customs required two checks, and the distance from customs to the boarding gate was quite long. On the way back, I recommend exploring and eating at the gate. You don't have to crowd the outermost area; the restaurants inside are just like the airport lobby. Best of all, they were less crowded, allowing you to leisurely wait for your flight. We had some fast food recommended by a local. The cola looked like root beer, served from a machine that looked like draft beer. It was quite interesting. The pancakes were surprisingly delicious—large, crispy, and generously prepared.",Neutral

The overall design feels a bit dated, and some areas can be quite empty or underwhelming in terms of atmosphere. While functional, it doesn’t offer the same level of comfort, innovation, or world-class amenities that Changi is known for.

"The airport is clean. When you get off at Terminal 1, follow the arrivals signs and continue walking until you reach the terminal where you must take the elevator. You must take the elevator to get to the main terminal. There are many duty-free shops nearby. It might seem strange because it's different from Korea, but don't worry. Just keep going straight and take the elevator. Once you get off, go straight for a bit and then descend to the basement. You'll need to go down to the arrivals hall. The problem here is that the wait for immigration can sometimes exceed an hour. The line for complete immigration is incredibly long. You'll need to pass through here to collect your luggage and exit. It can be a little confusing, but just remember that you have to take the elevator, walk a bit, and then descend to the basement.

"Edit: upon arrival as of June 2025, they removed auto entry now for foreign passports and only locals can go through them- what a waste of automated gates!

KLIA is a massive airport, but as of December 2024, it’s still undergoing some upgrading works, so not everything is fully operational (has been going on for the past year). Shops and dining options are still quite limited despite the airport's large size, which is a bit disappointing for travelers looking to explore or relax before their flights.

On the positive side, for certain passport holders, the biometric scanning at immigration makes the process quick and efficient, which is a welcome convenience. However, the baggage scanning process remains tedious—you’re required to scan your bags multiple times, such as when entering immigration and again when heading to your gate. Personally, this feels unnecessarily repetitive, but there’s little travelers can do about it.

Overall, KLIA has potential, and hopefully, the ongoing upgrades will bring noticeable improvements to both the facilities and passenger experience in the near future.",Neutral

Gates are clearly signposted and the amount of walking is not too challenging.

The usual recommendation to be at the airport at least 3 hours before departure should be strictly adhered to.

It's important to stay calm and ask for the airline at the information counter.
The signage at the counters is small and you would have to look through all of them until you find the right one. (If you fly with Etihad Airways... it's counter A.)

It's best to check in online... it saves time. There were initially only a few counters open and some passengers had a lot of suitcases that were all weighed and labeled. The same thing happens with hand luggage.

As soon as you have got rid of your checked baggage, it is best to go to immigration without hesitation and then you can stand in line again.

The KFC location is also not well-indicated, making it difficult for first-time visitors to find.

"Disappointed with KLIA1’s Renovation – Where’s the Local Flavor?

I’ve traveled through KLIA countless times over the years, and it has always impressed me with its cleanliness, easy check-in process, and efficient security checks. The architecture, influenced by Malaysian, Islamic, and natural elements, is a highlight. But what made KLIA truly special was the presence of local food, beverages, and products.

With the recent renovation of KLIA1, I have to say I am very pleased with the new improved bathrooms- better designed, clean and dry :) But I’ve noticed a disappointing shift—many local offerings have been replaced by foreign goods, with alcohol and tobacco dominating the retail space. I was shocked to find only one shelf of Malaysian food products in the entire terminal! Malaysia is a foodie paradise with so much to offer- why isn’t KLIA showcasing it?

Previously, there were great local cafés serving authentic Malaysian dishes like prawn noodles and teh tarik. Now, all I see are global chains like Starbucks and Gloria Jean’s. Can’t there be more homegrown F&B options for travelers to experience real Malaysian flavors?

To top it off, the monorail is still not working (shuttle busses are the alternate) and my  attempt to ask an ‘Ask Me For Help’ staff member about food options was met with disinterest—she was too busy scrolling on her phone to assist me properly. KLIA, we can do better! Support local businesses and bring back the Malaysian experience!",Neutral
Good airport but still a lot of improvement can be done by adding more facilities,Neutral
"Airport Terminal 1 boasts modern upgrades to its luggage drop, check-in, immigration processes, and overall size.  It's  located approximately 60 minutes from Kuala Lumpur by car, or a quicker 45-minute journey via express train. ✈️🚄

However, there are a few areas for potential improvement. 🤔

1.  Currently, there is a lack of a dedicated food court. While some cafes and pantries offer refreshments, the options are limited to cold food, and the only Burger King is situated at Gate C, inconveniently distant from other gates. 🍔🍟🙁

2.  Seating is somewhat limited. 🪑💺

3.  Entertainment options for children and families could be expanded. 🧸🎮🎈

4.  The washrooms could be enhanced by providing tissue paper in the hand-wash areas. 🧻🧼🚰

5.  Duty-free prices may be considered slightly higher than in some other countries. 💲⬆️

The airport does offer complimentary Wi-Fi access for all passengers and provides adequate restroom facilities.  📶🚽👍",Neutral
"1. The structure is unique.

2. The structure where entry and exit meet at the duty-free shop.

3. Because of this, security checks are done in front of the gate.

4. The duty-free shop sells various things, but there is no price merit.

5. There are many cafes such as Starbucks and Coffee Bean and places to eat light meals.

6. There is a smoking room near C31 in Terminal 1. It is very poorly ventilated.

7. The smoking room in C11 is less crowded and more comfortable.

8. The Korean Air counter is near Exit K. 8.",Neutral
Nice airport but a lot of rush.,Neutral
"Kuala Lumpur International Airport is generally fine, clean, and organized. My experience with the immigration officer was also nice, they were polite and professional.

However, the immigration line was extremely long. We ended up waiting around 2 hours just to get through. It would be much better if they had autogates available for all international visitors, not just for selected countries. That would save so much time and make the arrival process smoother.

Overall, the airport itself is good, but the long wait at immigration was really exhausting.",Neutral
"Nice, modern airport with a variety of shops and restaurants. The one thing lacking is power outlets. They are extremely hard to find so charging your phone is a headache.",Neutral
"Edit: upon arrival, they removed auto entry now for foreign passports and only locals can go through them- what a waste of automated gates!

KLIA is a massive airport, but as of December 2024, it’s still undergoing some upgrading works, so not everything is fully operational (has been going on for the past year). Shops and dining options are still quite limited despite the airport's large size, which is a bit disappointing for travelers looking to explore or relax before their flights.

On the positive side, for certain passport holders, the biometric scanning at immigration makes the process quick and efficient, which is a welcome convenience. However, the baggage scanning process remains tedious—you’re required to scan your bags multiple times, such as when entering immigration and again when heading to your gate. Personally, this feels unnecessarily repetitive, but there’s little travelers can do about it.

Overall, KLIA has potential, and hopefully, the ongoing upgrades will bring noticeable improvements to both the facilities and passenger experience in the near future.",Neutral

"I used Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) ✈️✨

The terminal is large, the signs are easy to understand,
and there is plenty of English, so even those who are not used to traveling abroad can feel at ease 🗺️🛫

There are plenty of duty-free shops and restaurants, so I was able to spend my time before departure and transfer without getting bored 🛍️🍽️
There is also a food court where you can enjoy local food, so you can enjoy your last Malaysian gourmet before departure 🍜🍍

In addition, the toilets, lounges, and Wi-Fi environment are well-equipped,
so I was able to spend my time comfortably before and after a long flight 📶🛋️

✔️ A spacious, clean, and modern airport 🏢
✔️ Plenty of dining, shopping, and relaxation facilities 🛍️🍴
✔️ Convenient and easy to understand for transit💡
✔️ Experience Malaysian vibes until the end of your trip🇲🇾

"هذه السنة تحسنت خدمات المطار بشكل واضح عن كل السنوات السابقة،

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is more than just a travel hub — it’s a complete experience that blends efficiency, comfort, and a touch of Malaysian hospitality. From the moment you arrive, the design of the airport stands out. The main terminal building is bright, spacious, and airy, with a modern architectural style that still feels warm and welcoming. The satellite building, connected by the Aerotrain, adds to the sense of scale and convenience, making it easy for passengers to transfer between terminals.

In terms of navigation, KLIA is well signposted, with clear directions in English and Malay. Even for first-time visitors, it’s relatively simple to find immigration, baggage claim, and onward connections. While the airport is large, the layout is intuitive, and staff members are friendly and ready to assist if you ever feel lost. Immigration and security checks are usually smooth and efficient, although during peak travel hours there can be queues — nothing unusual for an airport of this size.

The facilities here are excellent. There is a wide variety of food and drink options catering to every budget, from local Malaysian dishes (which I highly recommend if you have time) to international fast food, coffee shops, and sit-down restaurants. Shopping is also a highlight — the duty-free selection is extensive, with everything from cosmetics and electronics to Malaysian souvenirs and delicacies.

If you’re in transit or have a long layover, KLIA makes the wait comfortable. There are plenty of lounges, seating areas, and even a capsule hotel where you can book a few hours of rest. The airport also has prayer rooms, child-friendly facilities, and smoking zones, which shows that it caters thoughtfully to different types of travelers. Free Wi-Fi is available, though it can sometimes be a little slow, so it’s good to have mobile data as backup.

Getting to and from the airport is extremely convenient. The KLIA Ekspres train is one of the best features — it takes just under 30 minutes to reach KL Sentral in the city center, and it’s fast, comfortable, and reliable. Taxis and ride-hailing services are also widely available, and buses provide budget-friendly options.

One thing to keep in mind is that the airport is quite large, so be prepared to walk a fair bit between gates or from security to boarding. For some travelers, this can be tiring, but the clear signage and moving walkways help a lot.

Overall, KLIA is a world-class airport that balances efficiency with comfort. It’s clean, modern, and well-maintained, but it also has a distinct cultural touch that reminds you you’re in Malaysia. Whether you’re arriving, departing, or transiting, KLIA leaves a positive impression and sets the tone for a great journey.",Positive

"I had an amazing experience with the staff at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. On the evening of March 17th, I lost my tablet in the satellite building due to my own carelessness. I only realized it was missing when I was already in the main terminal building, and I was worried I might never get it back.

However, the airport staff were incredibly helpful! They quickly assisted me in locating my tablet and went above and beyond—one of them personally delivered it to me from the other building. Their professionalism, efficiency, and kindness truly made a difference.

I am extremely grateful for their outstanding service and support. Thank you to the amazing team at KLIA for ensuring such a smooth and reassuring experience!",Positive
"(Visiting before 2024)
This time, I flew Air Asia, a Malaysian budget airline, to Kuala Lumpur International Airport for connecting flights to other countries.
Kuala Lumpur International Airport has several terminals. Kuala Lumpur is a very large international airport, and if you have a layover or a long layover, you can take a shuttle bus to different terminals.
The main hall is quite large, but if you're traveling between terminals, you need to plan your transfer time and board your flight accordingly.",Positive

Good day to all in KLIA 2. Today we are flying to Tiruchirappalli with AK 25. The best thing is when we checked in our luggage 🧳 at Y12 we met counter girl so sweet looking very friendly very pleasant so helpful 😊 named Miss Raashini AP Shamugam had given us a deep sweet impression of the service provided by KLIA 2. Miss Raashini allowed me to take out some clothes when we have exceeded our limit of 20kg. We wish to apologise to Miss Raashini with our lack of knowledge we have unnoticely created a long queue behind us. We apologise for our action. We are truly Sorry. Other than the above Miss Raashini had advise us on the purchase of weight which is much cheaper when purchased on a different passenger.  You can see that Miss Raashini is so honest when she can actually charge me extra few hundred for the additional weight on my luggage. We really appreciated the kindness Miss Raashini had provided us. We really appreciated KLIA 2 for providing us with a honest trusted service. We really appreciated you Miss Raashini. We really appreciated KLIA 2 for having such a lovely trustworthy employee. May success be with you Miss Raashini. May success prosperity continuously be with you KLIA2. Thank you very much with gratitude from us all. Have a lovely day to all in KLIA2. Best Regards Denise Leong Suresh and Shaman,Positive

"🇪🇸♥️🇲🇾 A seamless experience at KLIA, one of the best airports in Southeast Asia♥️

Traveling through Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is always comfortable and efficient. From the moment you arrive, you're greeted by a modern, clean, and well-organized facility, where it's clear that passenger comfort and overall smooth operation are a priority. 🤞🏻

Passport control is very streamlined, especially if you're eligible to use the automated e-gates (it's worth checking if your passport is listed). The entire process is quick and hassle-free, which is a great start to any international trip. 👍🏻

Once you clear immigration, the airport is spacious and very well-maintained. The gates for Area C are easily reached via a regular shuttle train that departs after passport control. Everything is well signposted and easy to navigate.

There are tons of options for both shopping and dining, so you'll never feel bored while you wait. From duty-free shops to local and international restaurants, there's plenty to discover before boarding.

A helpful tip: KLIA is approximately 45 minutes from downtown Kuala Lumpur (KLCC) if you travel early in the morning when there's no traffic. During the day, it's a good idea to allow between one and one hour and ten minutes, depending on congestion.

We traveled from Terminal 1, which serves many major international airlines such as Etihad (A), Emirates (B), Turkish Airlines (M), and several others. It's advisable to check your gate assignment in advance, as it can change shortly before departure!

We had the opportunity to try Illy coffee near Gate C13. Although there was quite a line, service was quick once the order was placed. The staff was friendly and helpful. However, the coffee left something to be desired. The Americano and cappuccino had a strange taste, somewhat resembling burnt marshmallows. Still, the sourdough bakery selection was quite good, with fresh and satisfying options for pre-flight snacks.

Overall, KLIA is an excellent international hub. Clean, efficient, and well-thought-out. If they improve the coffee quality a bit in some areas, it would be near perfect. Still, I would definitely transit or depart from KLIA again. Highly recommended for both frequent travelers and first-time flyers.

🇬🇧 Smooth Experience at KLIA - One of Southeast Asia's Best Airports!

Traveling through Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is always a comfortable and efficient experience. From the moment you arrive, you're met with a clean, modern, and well-organized facility that clearly prioritizes both passenger comfort and operational efficiency. ♥️

Passport control is a breeze, especially if you're eligible to use the automated e-gates (check if your passport is listed beforehand). The process is quick and fuss-free... a great start to any international journey🥰

Once you pass immigration, you'll find the airport impressively spacious and well-maintained. The departure gates at Concourse C are accessible by a smooth and regular train shuttle after passport control; very simple with clear signage throughout👍🏻

Retail and dining options are abundant, so you'll never feel bored during your wait. From duty-free shops to local and international eateries, there's plenty to explore while waiting for your flight.

A small note on timing ⛈️ KLIA is located around 45 minutes from KLCC (city centre) early in the morning when traffic is light. However, during daytime hours, I recommend allowing at least 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes for the journey, depending on traffic conditions!!!

We flew out of Terminal 1, which handles many major international carriers including Etihad (A), Emirates (B), Turkish Airlines (M) and several others. It’s worth double-checking your gate assignment as signage can sometimes be updated close to departure...",Positive

"I'm just passing through, I didn't leave the airport.
The airport is huge. The prices for beer at the airport are the same as in Almaty cafes.))",Positive
"I often use this airport when traveling to Southeast Asia or South Asia.
If I remember correctly, it was designed by Kurokawa Kisho.
Terminal 1 is home to many Malaysia Airlines flights.
Terminal 2 has a larger number of LCCs.
It's a fairly large airport, and Terminals 1 and 2 are quite far apart. You can take the shuttle bus or the high-speed train. It takes a while.

Terminal 1 also has a satellite terminal, and there is an unmanned train between the main terminal and the satellite terminal. This takes just a moment.
Terminal 1 also has a full range of duty-free shops and a wide selection of restaurants. At airport prices, though.
I was happy to see an airport piano.
The airport staff were all friendly and welcoming.

The exhibits inside the airport were also elaborate. When I visited, they were themed around Malacca.
The center is set up like a garden.
There are plenty of chairs, including some comfortable ones where you might want to take a nap.",Positive
"Feb 2025 - The new terminal is huge and beautiful, now competiting with other Asian big airports. Usual airport guide... just follow the signs or ask around to be guided not to get lost.

"June 24, 2025, Day 1
On the first day of my Southeast Asian adventure, I flew to Kuala Lumpur Airport. Perhaps because of the new terminal, the overall decor was fresh. During immigration, you could buy things and be greeted with tea, something not found at other airports.
Following the instructions, I boarded the shuttle bus and entered smoothly. If you're taking the express train, you can also follow the instructions. There's a significant difference in travel time between the express and regular trains, so I recommend taking the express line directly for a less crowded and more comfortable experience.",Positive
"English:
As expected from an airport in a developed country, it's large and well-maintained. There's even an outdoor jungle-style area.
Gate C requires a shuttle bus ride, but there are plenty of good restaurants.
It's a great place to spend time during a layover.

And what a joy to arrive at Kuala Lumpur airport 😀 Here everything is practical, easy, and when you don't know, there's someone to help you. The service is great for going through immigration, and then for the suitcases, they help you collect them and place them on a trolley. In addition, the travel bags arrive in a plastic basket so as not to damage them! You are still helped for customs control, and the exit is convenient with the ""Grab"" application or the KLIA express. Thank you for managing this (very clean) welcoming airport 😀",Positive
"Top long queue on immigration, other than that a great experience.",Positive
The most prestigious Airport in the world.,Positive
"(2025) KLIA1 has 2 distinct buildings - main building and satellite building (for departure gate c), which is accessible via shuttle bus.

(2024) KLIA2 is modern, huge and features many prominent shops (e.g. supermarket, convenience stores, F&B outlets), however you have to pass through 2 immigration screening (i.e. one at the departure hall and the other being the specific gate terminal, my case being the 'P' gate). Wonder if it's really necessary as it seems to slow down the departure experience considerably?",Positive
"So, I didn't think it was bad. My six-hour stay was quite well spent here. No great pomp, clean restrooms, clear connecting paths. Even the food and small souvenirs are still relatively inexpensive after midnight.",Positive

I also love the variety of dining and shopping options; whether I’m craving local Malaysian cuisine, international favorites, or just a quick coffee, there’s always something to satisfy. The airport staff are friendly and helpful, making every transit smooth and stress-free. What really stands out is the overall vibe—KLIA manages to feel modern, efficient, and welcoming all at once. Even after many trips, I still find little things to enjoy and appreciate here. Truly, KLIA sets a high standard for airports, and I always look forward to my next visit!",Positive

The must go places when I need to go back at my village.,Positive

There is train and bus transportation to KL Sentral, various restaurant facilities, only for immigration there is a long queue because it coincides with the arrival of other international flights

Oh yes, there is also an airport taxi to KL Sentral, negotiable, finally with a Hiace car for 300RM, what's nice here is the free wifi is quite fast",Positive

"✈️ Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) – A Major Asian Hub with Smooth Connectivity | Travel Consultant Review

As a travel consultant, I often recommend KLIA as a transit point or entry to Southeast Asia. Here's a breakdown of the experience:

🌟 Highlights:
✅ Modern Infrastructure
KLIA is clean, spacious, and well-designed. The terminals—KLIA (Main Terminal) and KLIA2 (Low-cost Terminal)—are efficiently connected via train and shuttle.

✅ Connectivity
Excellent connectivity via ERL (Express Rail Link) to central Kuala Lumpur in just ~30 minutes. Clear signage in English and Malay makes navigation easy for international travelers.

✅ Immigration & Security
Immigration can be quick during non-peak hours, but delays are possible during busy times. Security is generally smooth and well-organized.

✅ Shopping & Amenities
KLIA offers duty-free shops, premium brands, local crafts, and great food courts. Muslim prayer rooms, child play areas, lounges, and clean restrooms add to the comfort.

✅ Hospitality & Help Desks
Friendly and professional staff. Help counters and digital info kiosks are helpful, especially for first-time visitors.

⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind:
KLIA2 is separate and caters mostly to AirAsia and budget carriers—plan accordingly if you have a connecting flight between KLIA and KLIA2.

Transit times between gates can be long; allow extra time, especially for international connections.

🧳 Consultant’s Tip:
Use the Plaza Premium Lounge for long layovers—it’s affordable and well-equipped. Download the Malaysia Airports app for real-time updates and gate information.

Overall Rating: 8.5/10
A world-class airport that balances efficiency with Malaysian hospitality—ideal for smooth international transit or as a gateway to explore Malaysia.",Positive

Superb airport when you’re in transit service. It’s a little busy terminal but very convenient to travel with train in different building.,Positive
It’s a big place. Come too early and most of the shopping streets are not open. Is Kuala Lumpur boring? But everything is delicious 🤤 What a holy place for delicious food,Positive
"It's so spacious! I used the bus when I arrived with ANA, and also took the bus to the ANA gate on my way back.

The project officially opened in 1998, serving both domestic and international flights. KLIA has two main terminals: Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 (klia2). Traveling between terminals can be done by Aerotrain or shuttle bus. From Kuala Lumpur to the airport, passengers often choose the KLIA Ekspres train with a travel time of about 28 minutes.

One of the best airport in the world.....,Positive
"One of the better airports in Asean. Functioning Autogates. Good layout, spacious, tidy & clean. Good service. Price of goods at the airport & Duty Free area were prominently displayed (no room for shop operators to cheat). Exchange rates at money changer counters were also prominently displayed (no room for money changer operators to cheat).",Positive
"One of beautiful and big airports I have visited. The only challenge is that it is a bit far from the city so one needs to plan accordingly.
One small tip, if you are travelling more than two, it’s better to go to the city using the grab cab rather than the KLIA express.
There is a lot of shopping options in the city, I could not find much shops in my terminal. But still there are enough to shop in case you are looking forward to shop some duty free items.
Overall a good experience.
Happy travelling!!!!",Positive
Always great experience with their best service,Positive

P/S: it is not always jammed but better be prepared.",Positive
"There you will find all kinds of shops, restaurants and modern equipment.",Positive
I would  suggest any airport looking to expand pay KUL a visit a really great transfer point. I guess the one drawback being Malaysia Airlines no longer have the network or flight frequency it once had. I look forward to visiting again and staying for longer than a transfer.,Positive

Informed the flight crew who arranged the wheelchair service who picked up the family member once landed from the plane, pushed them all the way through immigration, baggage retrieval and all the way to the car park. Genuine and sincere",Positive
"The airport is clean, well-maintained, and aesthetically pleasing. The staff is friendly and helpful, making my first visit to Malaysia welcoming despite initial nervousness. I was  ball of nerves but immigration officer was patient with me. However, my return experience was marred by an immigration officer, ""Aya"" (if I recall correctly), who was rude and loud. This was disappointing and impacted my overall experience. Politeness costs nothing but can significantly influence someone's perception of a country. While this incident was hurtful, it contrasted with the warm and professional interactions I had with other staff and locals during my visit, which were overwhelmingly positive. I will surely visit the country again.",Positive
Okay,Positive
"One of the best airports! Free water filters,  clean toilets,  free wifi,  new guides wearing a sash 'ask me',  friendly and able to communicate in english.

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is one of the most convenient and well-organized airports in Southeast Asia. It serves as Malaysia’s main international gateway and is located about 45 minutes from the city center. Whether you’re arriving, departing, or just on a layover, KLIA offers a smooth and pleasant airport experience.

The airport is spacious, clean, and well-designed with clear signage and friendly staff ready to assist travelers. One of the things people really appreciate about KLIA is the wide variety of food options. If you’re in the mood for a quick bite, you’ll find familiar names like Burger King, perfect for grabbing fast food before your flight. There are also other cafés, local eateries, and international food chains to suit every taste.

KLIA is also a great place to do some last-minute shopping. There are plenty of duty-free stores, offering everything from snacks and souvenirs to premium items. For those who love fragrances, you’ll find perfume shops from various global brands, all neatly arranged and reasonably priced.

Whether you’re traveling for business or leisure, KLIA provides everything you need — from comfort and convenience to dining and shopping. It’s a great first and last impression of Malaysia, and a reminder of how far the country has come in terms of global connectivity and modern infrastructure…",Positive

"I have travelled today to my country from Kuala Lumpur International airport terminal, (Klia1).
The Airport KLIA 1 international departure terminal boarding on Malaysia airlines. The boarding was done for a couple of minutes and immigration also done fast. However in the waiting area. They make a little bit of time to clear security checks to clear the boarding. It takes ample time. After security check we clear the boarding quickly. The only thing is security check delay. Apart from that everything is fast. I dined at the International Airport Premium Longue.  It was  wonderful, clear and tidy. Amazing atmosphere. I had a nice experience from the Malaysian International Airport.",Positive
"Sprawling, shiny hub that juggles 57M passengers yearly with the grace of a seasoned ringmaster. Terminals 1 & 2 buzzing like a futuristic bazaar. Pampers with luxe lounges (try Plaza Premium for a nap pod!), while KLIA2 keeps budget travelers happy with AirAsia’s dominance and cheap eats like Nasi Lemak Wanjo. Pro tips: Breeze through immigration with the new biometric e-gates if you’re a frequent flyer register on arrival! The KLIA Ekspres (28 minutes to KL Sentral) is your wallet-friendly escape from taxi touts. Grab a SIM from the Tune Talk kiosk for instant 5G, and hit the revamped Eraman Duty-Free for local gems like Boh Tea or durian chocolate (yes, it’s a thing). Hungry? Myeongdong Topokki in KLIA2 serves spicy Korean bites to fuel your layover. Free Wi-Fi’s solid, but download the MySejahtera app for seamless travel updates. Watch out for peak hour crowds (mornings are manic). KLIA’s a smooth operator, blending efficiency with that Malaysian charm, just don’t linger too long at the chocolate stalls!

Services are available and everyone at the airport, from security to employees, is very cooperative. Do not hesitate to ask anyone who will help you. There was a little congestion due to the influx of tourists. There are car rental offices and stores that sell phone cards for a week, 35GB, and currency exchange offices.",Positive
Nice,Positive
It's a beautiful airport. I loved the variety of restaurants.,Positive

"I recently traveled from Bali to Mumbai with a layover at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) via Malaysia Airlines, and I had a smooth and pleasant experience.

The airport is well-organized and easy to navigate, even for transit passengers. Immigration and security checks were efficient, and the staff was professional and courteous. The signage was clear, making it easy to find my way to the connecting gate.

KLIA offers a great selection of duty-free shops, restaurants, and lounges, providing ample options to relax and refresh during a layover. The Wi-Fi was fast and reliable, which was helpful while waiting for my next flight.

The transit experience was seamless, and the airport's clean and modern facilities made the journey comfortable. Malaysia Airlines also provided excellent service, adding to the overall positive experience.

Overall, KLIA is a well-managed international hub, and I would definitely prefer transiting through here again.",Positive

"This place is very spacious, modern, and the procedures are quick.
Although not as impressive as in Thailand, it is still okay.",Positive
"Have been travelling to and from this airport for the best part of a decade now. Still has the old charms. The train shuttle between the satellite and main terminal is sorely missed and needs to restart soon. The behaviour of customs officials are getting worse. But overall, a quite nice place to spend the hours before a flight

Update: just seen them testing the new train yesterday. Looks impressive 👍",Positive
Lots of eating places to your taste. Best to eat freshly cooked meals like char queh tiao. Avoid eating the foods like chicken rice as you don't know how long it's been sitting there,Positive

"I used Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) ✈️✨
It is a vast airport that can be said to be the gateway to Malaysia,
and it was a very comfortable airport that combined modern facilities with a tropical atmosphere 🌴🌏

The terminal is large, the signs are easy to understand,
and there is plenty of English, so even those who are not used to traveling abroad can feel at ease 🗺️🛫

There are plenty of duty-free shops and restaurants, so I was able to spend my time before departure and transfer without getting bored 🛍️🍽️
There is also a food court where you can enjoy local food, so you can enjoy your last Malaysian gourmet before departure 🍜🍍

In addition, the toilets, lounges, and Wi-Fi environment are well-equipped,
so I was able to spend my time comfortably before and after a long flight 📶🛋️

[Recommended points]
✔️ A spacious, clean, and modern airport 🏢
✔️ Plenty of dining, shopping, and relaxation facilities 🛍️🍴
✔️ Convenient and easy to understand for transit💡
✔️ Experience Malaysian vibes until the end of your trip🇲🇾

It was a comfortable airport, perfect for the start of your trip or for a moment before returning home✈️

Domestic flights are generally well-managed, although security checks can be a bit slow at times.

The airport itself is modern, spacious, and packed with shopping and dining options — definitely one of the better hubs in Southeast Asia.",Positive
There are many shops in the area.,Positive
"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA)** is Malaysia's main international aviation hub and one of the busiest airports in Southeast Asia. Located in Sepang, Selangor, approximately 50 kilometres from Kuala Lumpur city centre, it offers modern facilities and convenient transport links.

KLIA is divided into a main terminal (KLIA1) and a low-cost terminal (KLIA2), which serve traditional and low-cost airlines. The main terminal is elegantly designed and fully functional, integrating modern architecture and Malay cultural elements.

"KLIA is a pretty solid airport! There are tons of shops to browse through and plenty of food options if you’re feeling hungry—everything from local snacks to international bites. It definitely makes layovers or early check-ins way more enjoyable.

That said, the layout can be a bit confusing, especially when figuring out immigration and which terminal to go to. Just give yourself a bit of extra time if it’s your first time here. Overall, still a great airport with good amenities!",Positive
Nice place but need more space,Positive
A bit confusing airport but you can always ask around and get there!,Positive
"My first landing on KLIA terminal 1, on Januari 2025. Nice and modern airport, with clean and convenient 'Tandas' or toilet. My husband left his phone about 15minute in this Tandas area, and find it again in the same position. Thank you for the cleaning service in the gate H area. And we stay in this airport for 10hours transit, and in this place we can meet the people from all the nations as same as we are for chillin, sight seeing and even sleeping for killin time for the next flight. Nice experience but the escalator are too noise, so i suggest you who want to try sleeping or take a rest avoid the escalator area. Have a nice trip everyone..!!!",Positive

"After my recent experience at Nice and CDG airports (in France), I'm continuing my chronicle of everything a traveler has to go through! And what a joy to arrive at Kuala Lumpur airport 😀 Here everything is practical, easy, and when you don't know, there's someone to help you. The service is great for going through immigration, and then for the suitcases, they help you collect them and place them on a trolley. In addition, the travel bags arrive in a plastic basket so as not to damage them! You are still helped for customs control, and the exit is convenient with the ""Grab"" application or the KLIA express. Thank you for managing this (very clean) welcoming airport 😀
After further trips from this airport, I am still very satisfied.",Positive
"Good international airport. Immigration can be crowded, but nowadays a lot of countries can use the auto scanners. At least European countries. Look up before you travel and don’t forget to fill out the registration at least 3 days before arriving.",Positive

"Flying out or landing in KLIA2?

Here’s a quick dose: KLIA2 opened in 2014 to replace the old LCCT (Low-Cost Carrier Terminal)and is now the home base for airlines like AirAsia and is one of the biggest purpose-built low-cost terminals in the world!

Yes..so big you can literally walk 2km (I think its more..) inside to get to your boarding gate….so be sure to wear comfy shoes or your best cushioned disco sandals (or bring a scooter?)

Gateway@KLIA2 is connected to the terminal, packed with food, stores & even a grocery! It’s like a mini shopping mall with gates, to the extent you could arrive with just credit and dress up from top to bottom complete with rolling luggage to rock the day.

Flying via KLIA2 makes you an early bird even if you are a marathon runner (kudos to you if you have pre-checked in and zero check in luggage). Get there at least 3 hours early—immigration lines can be sneaky long… or check into the many aerohotels or capsule hotels (sama-sama) for a place to crash.

Enjoy the lounge or play the Malaysian “national sport”and explore vast culinary from nasi lemak to homeland FuiYoh uncle Roger’s fried rice and delicate steamed dumplings from din tai fung or A&W and McDonalds, doze on a massage chair or people watch till you daze if you have plenty of time to kill.

Currency exchanges are all around (RHB’s rate is not bad)

KLIA Ekspres from KL Sentral gets you there fast & comfy.

E-hailing is a buzz with tonnes of queues at level 1

Whether you’re heading off to new adventures or coming home to Nasi Lemak, KLIA2’s got your back.",Positive
"📍 Kuala Lumpur International Airport

-Easy to reach by taxi, bus, or train. Signs and directions are clear, even for first-timers.

-The terminal is clean and well-maintained. Toilets and waiting areas are regularly cleaned.

-Lots of shops, restaurants, and duty-free stores.

-Check-in and security processes are smooth most of the time. Friendly staff, but queues can get long during peak travel seasons

"Very nice airport with a variety of things to do here from different eateries to a variety of souvineer shops, chocolatiers, etc. and to all the gentlemen out there, they have a barber shop as well.

The Aerosmith train to get from one side of the airport to the other side is very handy too.",Positive
"KLIA Main Terminal: Designed by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa and opened in 1998, its architectural style combines modern technology with tropical rainforest elements.

Skybridge and Transfer Design: The main terminal and satellite terminal are connected by a high-speed train (Aerotrain), creating a seamless flow of traffic.

Nature Integration: The satellite terminal even features a tropical rainforest sanctuary in its atrium, allowing passengers to enjoy a stroll during their layovers—a rare feature worldwide.",Positive
"This year, airport services have improved significantly compared to all previous years.

For countries that do not require a visa, you can enter through the electronic gates, such as Malaysians.

But when entering through these gates, your passport is not stamped, and you do not deal with any employee. You just put your passport on the gate, then look at the camera, and within seconds you enter Malaysia 🇲🇾.

I love Malaysia very much, and I love all their food, especially durian 😋",Positive

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is undoubtedly one of the most modern and efficient hubs in Southeast Asia. The facilities are spacious, clean, and well-signposted, making travel easy, even for those unfamiliar with the area. Connections to the city center via the KLIA Express train are fast and convenient, allowing passengers to reach the capital in just 30 minutes. The dining scene is also varied, with local and international options available in both the arrivals and departures areas.

The security and customer service staff are generally friendly and helpful, and immigration controls are usually relatively smooth if you don't arrive during rush hour.

However, one of KLIA's major weaknesses is the limited number of rest areas for passengers in transit or with long layovers. Although there are some VIP lounges and capsule hotels with a fee, the airport doesn't offer enough comfortable public areas for reclining or sleeping, something that is sorely lacking when it comes to overnight waits or long connections. Improvements in this area would make the overall experience much more pleasant.

In short, an efficient and modern airport, but one that needs to consider the comfort of travelers in transit more.",Positive
Super effing friendly service,Positive
the best airport in malaysia,Positive
"A very modernized international airport for the region. It shows this great country has room for improvements, for example, the signages are not very clear and the washroom facilities are not as modern as some other Asian countries.

This was the largest airport I’ve ever been to. Lots of things to do. Very easy to get lost.,Positive
"Sprawling, shiny hub that juggles 57M passengers yearly with the grace of a seasoned ringmaster. Terminals 1 & 2 buzzing like a futuristic bazaar. Pampers with luxe lounges (try Plaza Premium for a nap pod!), while KLIA2 keeps budget travelers happy with AirAsia’s dominance and cheap eats like Nasi Lemak Wanjo. Pro tips: Breeze through immigration with the new biometric e-gates if you’re a frequent flyer register on arrival! The KLIA Ekspres (28 minutes to KL Sentral) is your wallet-friendly escape from taxi touts. Grab a SIM from the Tune Talk kiosk for instant 5G, and hit the revamped Eraman Duty-Free for local gems like Boh Tea or durian chocolate (yes, it’s a thing). Hungry? Myeongdong Topokki in KLIA2 serves spicy Korean bites to fuel your layover. Free Wi-Fi’s solid, but download the MySejahtera app for seamless travel updates. Watch out for peak hour crowds (mornings are manic). KLIA’s a smooth operator, blending efficiency with that Malaysian charm, just don’t linger too long at the chocolate stalls!

There are not many local souvenirs, but they are available.",Positive

"Nothing to complain about to be honest. It’s huge, it’s convenient, you’ll find a restroom in like every 20 steps. The whole space smelled of citronella which I didn’t know why either, but maybe they just like the smell since the plane smelled the same (will be a bit dizzying if you’re not an Asian and isn’t used to this strong scent). The transit area was relatively small compared to other airports so the staff only let you in when it’s like only minutes until the flight, which was understandable so I don’t blame them - you can always settle for a drink or snack at a nearby stall. The staff were friendly and helpful, albeit a little change of plans (my boarding gate was switched), I was well informed of where and when I should queue to board. Thanks to Trip.com’s flight tracking notifications as well haha",Positive

"Modern, well-connected, and spacious international airport

Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is one of Southeast Asia’s most impressive airports. It’s clean, well-organized, and offers plenty of services for both international and domestic travelers. The airport is split into two terminals: KLIA (main terminal) for full-service airlines and KLIA2 for budget carriers like AirAsia. A free shuttle bus runs between them frequently, which is super convenient.

The main terminal (KLIA) is spacious with high ceilings and even includes a small indoor rainforest—a really unique touch! Immigration and customs can be slow during peak hours, but the staff are generally friendly and helpful. Signage throughout the airport is clear, and it’s easy to find your way around.

KLIA2 is more modern in terms of retail options, offering a wide variety of shops, restaurants, and lounges. It has more of a shopping mall feel and is perfect if you have a long layover. However, walking distances can be long, so plan accordingly.

The KLIA Ekspres train makes travel to and from downtown Kuala Lumpur quick and easy (about 30 minutes), which is a major plus.

Some downsides include occasional delays at immigration and certain gates that require shuttle buses, which isn’t ideal for tired travelers. Still, overall, KLIA is a great airport—efficient, comfortable, and a solid first impression of Malaysia.",Positive

"I was in transit through KLIA Terminal 1 and had a very smooth experience. The airport is spacious, clean, and well organized, with clear signs that make it easy to move around. For long gates, there is a train facility connecting buildings, which makes reaching your gate quick and convenient.

There’s a nice park for kids to play and enjoy, which is perfect for families during layovers. I was also impressed by the variety of food options – plenty of vegetarian and non-vegetarian restaurants to choose from. The lounges and seating areas are comfortable, and the staff were friendly and helpful.

"It is so organized, it has 2 terminals, you scan your baggage control ticket from the first terminal and then take a bus to the second terminal. Here you go through the control and pass to the aprons where you will board the plane. There are not many shops inside, food and drinks are at normal prices, not airport prices.

"✈️ Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) – A Major Asian Hub with Smooth Connectivity | Travel Consultant Review

As a travel consultant, I often recommend KLIA as a transit point or entry to Southeast Asia. Here's a breakdown of the experience:

🌟 Highlights:
✅ Modern Infrastructure
KLIA is clean, spacious, and well-designed. The terminals—KLIA (Main Terminal) and KLIA2 (Low-cost Terminal)—are efficiently connected via train and shuttle.

✅ Connectivity
Excellent connectivity via ERL (Express Rail Link) to central Kuala Lumpur in just ~30 minutes. Clear signage in English and Malay makes navigation easy for international travelers.

✅ Immigration & Security
Immigration can be quick during non-peak hours, but delays are possible during busy times. Security is generally smooth and well-organized.

✅ Shopping & Amenities
KLIA offers duty-free shops, premium brands, local crafts, and great food courts. Muslim prayer rooms, child play areas, lounges, and clean restrooms add to the comfort.

✅ Hospitality & Help Desks
Friendly and professional staff. Help counters and digital info kiosks are helpful, especially for first-time visitors.

⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind:
KLIA2 is separate and caters mostly to AirAsia and budget carriers—plan accordingly if you have a connecting flight between KLIA and KLIA2.

Transit times between gates can be long; allow extra time, especially for international connections.

🧳 Consultant’s Tip:
Use the Plaza Premium Lounge for long layovers—it’s affordable and well-equipped. Download the Malaysia Airports app for real-time updates and gate information.

Overall Rating: 8.5/10
A world-class airport that balances efficiency with Malaysian hospitality—ideal for smooth international transit or as a gateway to explore Malaysia.",Positive
"After the major renovation, KLIA has a completely new look, a truly stunning experience.

The shops and locations within the terminal remain the same, allowing passengers to browse freely, shop, dine, and more, all at their own pace, without having to search for them.",Positive
"Various facilities are available here. Comfortable food and accommodation. However, the price is a bit pricy because it is at the airport.",Positive
This large and beautiful airport has a forest park inside.,Positive
Big airport and can print off documents if needed at Baggage solutions.,Positive
"One of the few airports where arrivals and departures share the same zone, but efficient signage ensures seamless navigation to baggage claim and passport control. This layout also provides an extra opportunity for duty-free shopping if that’s of interest.

The additional luggage scan before exiting can be a bit inconvenient, especially for those with multiple bags, as not all airports require this step. However, the airport maintains a modern, clean, and well-organized environment, making for a smooth overall experience.",Positive
"My connecting flight to Seoul was pushed to the next morning. The airport staff was very helpful, I was given meal/hotel vouchers and there were no further problems from the airport whatsoever. Many restaurants and shops, transfer to the other terminal by a shuttle bus. Very clean and little to no lines. Quick security check as well. Definitely recommend KUL if you must do a transfer!",Positive

No much huge renovation but the parking system upgraded and easier to make payment not need stuck at the entrance and exit. The gate is really convenient.,Positive
"KLIA is a very spacious airport with a layout that still feels impressive. The building itself is quite old, but it has been reasonably well maintained. Public facilities, including the toilets, are generally clean, and there are plenty of shops and tenants to explore, which makes long layovers or transit times less boring. That said, a little modernization or refurbishment would make the airport feel more up-to-date. Staff presence is quite visible, and while some are very professional and well-trained, there are still others who could benefit from additional training to enhance service consistency.

Overall, KLIA is a good international hub, but as an airport—essentially a service product—continuous improvements in both facilities and staff service quality are key to maintaining a world-class standard.",Positive
That's a huge airport with flight to any other country,Positive
Passenger friendly and excellent customer service.,Positive
This is one of the best International Airport in the world. Having large shopping areas with branded and luxury items and top notch dining inside. One should also visit the jungle walk while transiting through this terminal airport.,Positive
"After my recent experience at Nice and CDG airports (in France), I'm continuing my chronicle of everything a traveler has to go through! And what a joy to arrive at Kuala Lumpur airport 😀 Here everything is practical, easy, and when you don't know, there's someone to help you. The service is great for going through immigration, and then for the suitcases, they help you collect them and place them on a trolley. In addition, the travel bags arrive in a plastic basket so as not to damage them! You are still helped for customs control, and the exit is convenient with the ""Grab"" application or the KLIA express. Thank you for managing this (very clean) welcoming airport 😀",Positive

"There were some good and not so good things about travelling through KL International Airport.

Hospitality from all staff I interacted with was good. It was helpful, friendly, and courteous. The airport was also very clean and had a lot of facilities. It is very spacious, which was both positive and negative. It meant that there was plenty of space to sit and relax before the flight and quiet places could be found. On the minus side, it meant a lot of walking to get from place to place, and at times, I found it to be a bit chaotic and disorganised, finding our way around. It was a bit of a longer walk for us to get to the gate. Once there, we hopped on a bus that drove us across the terminal grounds. This took a while, too. Once off the bus, it was another longer walk to the actual gate.",Positive

The efficiency of the train connecting the terminals is also generally well-regarded.

"1. The structure is unique.

2. Arrival and departure meet at the duty-free shop.

3. This means security screening is done at the gate.

4. The duty-free shop sells a variety of items, but there's no real price advantage.

5. There are numerous cafes and light meals, including Starbucks and Coffee Bean.

6. There's a smoking room near C31 in Terminal 1. It's very poorly ventilated.

7. The smoking room in C11 is less crowded and more comfortable.

8. The Korean Air counter is located near Gate K8.

9. The Starbucks near the Korean Air boarding area has very little merchandise.

10. The Starbucks in the concourse before the bus ride has a wide selection of merchandise.

11. The monorail has been replaced, making transportation between terminals slightly more convenient. (As of October 1, 2025)",Positive
Nice place to visit.,Positive
best care for safety,Positive
"Already the time to go back. International Arrivals terminal is very nice, BUT we cannot buy cigarettes at the duty free since the law in Malaysia is different : you have to pay taxes here.

But you can buy we you go back, at the Departures, after the immigration.

There's a lot of shops, restaurants and room to smoke cigarettes after the immigration. At the departures it can be hard to find, but it exist (at the domestic terminal, which is challenging since there is a bus to catch to go and come back (15 + 15 minutes to plan, be smart because it can be stressful).

All types of public transport are available.  Best, fastest, cheapest (practical) I think is via KLIA ekspress train [29 MYR to go and come back to KL]. Very easy to commute with KL.

Immigration services at the arrivals and at the departures are up to date, very efficient and staff is smiling, helping, caring and welcoming.",Positive

KLIA is a world-class airport with modern facilities, clean spaces, and smooth connectivity. The signage is clear, staff are helpful, and the overall vibe is calm and organized.

"Kuala Lumpur international airport was one of the most magnificent airports I have been able to visit. This airport is the main hub to the huge city of Kuala Lumpur. Located almost 50km+ away from the actual city, this absolutely massive airport features numerous runways, and terminals.

When we first arrived at the airport, we were relatively lost and confused! After more walking then my previous experiences in MLE, BLR, TRV, COK and CMB (all relatively smaller airports except BLR), we had to board a bus to another building in order to collect our baggage!

The terminals itself are a bit well designed. The baggage collection carousels are absolutely humungous. The airport shuttle bus between terminals is a bit cramped though, when you are carrying the carry-on baggage. On the bright side, it does have seats which great. There is more greenery in the terminal than I'd have expected, it is spotless and extremely clean. There is large variety of resturants, other shops and sim/money exchange places (way more expensive than outside of airport).

One thing I will highlight is the toilets are magnificent here. Whole other airports I've visited in India also have clean toilets, the hand drying systems aren't as advanced. I had a whale of a time inside the toilets in this airport, and I would rate them 5/5 star, no drama.

When we went to the airport for our return flight back home, we saw more of the beautiful views and architecture of the airport. It is more easier to navigate the departures in my opinion. And, I'm sure for most people even arrivals won't be hard to navigate, it had been a while since we had flown anyways.

I truly had a whale of a time in Kuala Lumpur international airport and was extremely impressed with the state of the art facilities. It also features KILA train service to the city center (KL Sentral) which is a cheaper alternative to redhing this airport (there quite far from the city). I'd love to visit Malaysia and this airport again in the future. Ps: the jetbridges are so much more convinent when boarding the airplanes! Really like those.",Positive
A spacious and modern airport,Positive
Very good,Positive
"KLIA is a big, modern, and easy airport to use. It has clean toilets, clear signs, and friendly staff. There are many restaurants and shops to choose from. Transport to the city is easy. Some areas look a bit old, and immigration or changing terminals can take time. But overall, it’s a good airport for all kinds of travelers.",Positive
"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA)! ✈️ Get ready for a travel hub that's as bustling as a beehive and as modern as a sci-fi movie set! 🤖 Imagine a place where you can embark on adventures, connect with people from all corners of the globe, and maybe even find a duty-free bargain or two! 🛍️✨

Picture yourself navigating the terminals, feeling like you're starring in your own international spy thriller (minus the actual danger, hopefully!), and wondering if you should grab one last cup of Malaysian teh tarik before boarding (spoiler alert: you definitely should!) ☕️🤩. You can explore the shops, admire the architecture, and maybe even people-watch while waiting for your flight, feeling like you're witnessing a microcosm of the world! 🌍🎬

However, let’s be honest, sometimes an ""international airport"" can feel a bit like a real-life game of ""dodge the rolling suitcases,"" where you're trying to navigate the crowds while also trying to avoid getting your toes run over 🧳😅. And while the excitement of travel is undeniable, you might also find yourself questioning your ability to resist the urge to buy all the travel-sized snacks, especially if you're a sucker for a pre-flight treat 🍫🍿.

Overall, Kuala Lumpur International Airport offers a dynamic and exciting experience, a place where you can start or end your journey, witness the magic of travel, and maybe even find a little bit of inspiration, even if you sometimes feel like you’re participating in a synchronized airport-walking marathon with a hundred other jet-setting individuals. Happy travels! 🗺️🛫

There is train and bus transportation to KL Sentral, various restaurant facilities, only for immigration there is a long queue because it coincides with the arrival of other international flights

"KLIA 1 is good, my second time here, the toilet clean, have plenty lift and escalator, also have a wheelchair access very comfortable",Positive
"Flying out or landing in KLIA2?

Here’s a quick dose: KLIA2 opened in 2014 to replace the old LCCT (Low-Cost Carrier Terminal)and is now the home base for airlines like AirAsia and is one of the biggest purpose-built low-cost terminals in the world!

Yes..so big you can literally walk 2km (I think its more..) inside to get to your boarding gate….so be sure to wear comfy shoes or your best cushioned disco sandals (or bring a scooter?)

Gateway@KLIA2 is connected to the terminal, packed with food, stores & even a grocery! It’s like a mini shopping mall with gates, to the extent you could arrive with just credit and dress up from top to bottom complete with rolling luggage to rock the day.

Flying via KLIA2 makes you an early bird even if you are a marathon runner (kudos to you if you have pre-checked in and zero check in luggage). Get there at least 3 hours early—immigration lines can be sneaky long… or check into the many aerohotels or capsule hotels (sama-sama) for a place to crash.

Enjoy the lounge or play the Malaysian “national sport”and explore vast culinary from nasi lemak to homeland FuiYoh uncle Roger’s fried rice and delicate steamed dumplings from din tai fung or A&W and McDonalds, doze on a massage chair or people watch till you daze if you have plenty of time to kill.

Currency exchanges are all around (RHB’s rate is not bad)

KLIA Ekspres from KL Sentral gets you there fast & comfy.

E-hailing is a buzz with tonnes of queues at level 1

Whether you’re heading off to new adventures or coming home to Nasi Lemak, KLIA2’s got your back.",Positive

For transit passengers, the airport is comfortable with plenty of seating, free Wi-Fi, and clear signage. The architecture and surrounding greenery also add a calm atmosphere, reflecting Malaysia’s natural beauty.

Overall, KLIA is a well-managed international hub that combines efficiency with hospitality, making it a pleasant gateway to Malaysia.",Positive
Beautiful airport all facilities ok,Positive
"Clean airport. Has 2 terminals. Located far off, but is well connected to the city by different transportation modes.",Positive
There is a cool jungle here in the Airport. This is my favorite airport. I love it.,Positive
"The magnificent KLIA airport and in my opinion Indonesia's international airport is no less magnificent and luxurious, the facilities are also adequate

There is train and bus transportation to KL Sentral, various restaurant facilities, only for immigration there is a long queue because it coincides with the arrival of other international flights

Oh yes, there is also an airport taxi to KL Sentral, negotiable, finally with a Hiace car for 300RM, what's nice here is the free wifi is quite fast",Positive

"I left my Patek Philippe watch at the security screening area. This gentleman, Amirul ran to the connecting bridge and return it to me. This watch not only worth a lot but also means alot to me. Once again, thank u very much Amirul and team.🙏😊",Positive
"Massive airport with an enormous number of shops. Operations are well streamlined with all the modern facilities. Staff may not be as polite as in Japan, but can give a decent rating. Wing shuttles are operated to reach to certain gates and the required information could be obtained via the information desk or the notice boards. Lounges are well maintained and spread across a wide area.",Positive
"Kuala Lumpur International Airport has two terminals: Terminal 1 for full-service carriers and Terminal 2 mainly for low-cost airlines, with a few exceptions. Terminal 1 has more upscale shops, while Terminal 2 offers more budget-friendly options and tends to be livelier.

The toilets are better than in many countries, but don’t expect too much.

If you're coming from KLCC, there's not much price difference between the airport express train and Grab. Grab might be a bit more expensive, but it's usually more convenient, especially with luggage.

You can take local trains and transfer to save money, but if you're carrying several suitcases, Grab is the way to go.",Positive
Excellent,Positive
Klia 1 is bigger and more comfortable...klia 2 is for LCC flights like Air Asia,Positive
"The airport is nice, no queues. There is a free bus between the terminals. There are lots of shops and restaurants. Everything is well marked, so you won't get lost.

Self-service counters and self bag drop make things easier, thumbs up for that.",Positive

"Comfortable, spacious. Kids can run around if they want😆",Positive

Very nice and clean environment..self boarding in kiosk make easy for the passengers to skip very long queue..,Positive
"Kuala Lumpur international airport was one of the most magnificent airports I have been able to visit. This airport is the main hub to the huge city of Kuala Lumpur. Located almost 50km+ away from the actual city, this absolutely massive airport features numerous runways, and terminals.

When we first arrived at the airport, we were relatively lost and confused! After more walking then my previous experiences in MLE, BLR, TRV, COK and CMB (all relatively smaller airports except BLR), we had to board a bus to another building in order to collect our baggage!

The terminals itself are a bit well designed. The baggage collection carousels are absolutely humungous. The airport shuttle bus between terminals is a bit cramped though, when you are carrying the carry-on baggage. On the bright side, it does have seats which great. There is more greenery in the terminal than I'd have expected, it is spotless and extremely clean. There is large variety of resturants, other shops and sim/money exchange places (way more expensive than outside of airport).

One thing I will highlight is the toilets are magnificent here. Whole other airports I've visited in India also have clean toilets, the hand drying systems aren't as advanced. I had a whale of a time inside the toilets in this airport, and I would rate them 5/5 star, no drama.

When we went to the airport for our return flight back home, we saw more of the beautiful views and architecture of the airport. It is more easier to navigate the departures in my opinion. And, I'm sure for most people even arrivals won't be hard to navigate, it had been a while since we had flown anyways.

I truly had a whale of a time in Kuala Lumpur international airport and was extremely impressed with the state of the art facilities. It also features KILA train service to the city center (KL Sentral) which is a cheaper alternative to redhing this airport (there quite far from the city). I'd love to visit Malaysia and this airport again in the future. Ps: the jetbridges are so much more convinent when boarding the airplanes! Really like those.",Positive
It's a place of departure,Positive
"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), Malaysia's main international airport, is located in Sepang District.
I prefer flying home from this airport to Indonesia, with its hassle-free service. The restrooms are clean, the staff are polite and friendly. The high-speed train ride is also short, and the people we asked questions also gave very good answers.",Positive
"Malaysia Airports is a modern and efficient international airport that provides convenient transportation and a comfortable travel experience. Clear signage within the airport makes it easy for passengers to find their boarding gates, baggage claim areas and other facilities. Whether it's a connecting flight or a first visit, the transportation connections and facilities here can meet most needs, but the people are quite right and the baggage inspection is strict.

There are also quite a variety of shops and restaurants in the airport. Passengers can taste local food or shop while waiting for their flights. There are a variety of products in the duty-free store, from perfumes and cosmetics to souvenirs, so you can buy them easily. Although the airport is not as large as some large international airports, its services and facilities are still satisfactory.

In addition, the transportation at Malaysia Airport is also very convenient. You can easily take a taxi or bus from the airport to the city or other areas. Overall, Malaysia Airports is an efficient, comfortable and well-equipped airport, making it a good choice for both local residents and international tourists.",Positive
"The process is a little more complicated than at other international airports, so it's a good idea to prepare a little earlier.",Positive
"Very proud to say KLIA in 2025 is so much improved. More shops, more facilities! Love it! Proud Malaysian! 🇲🇾",Positive
"KL Airport is a well-maintained and impressive airport. The staff and facilities were excellent. The airport is clean, spacious, and well-organized. Immigration and security processes were smooth and efficient, making the travel experience stress-free.",Positive
"Flying out or landing in KLIA2?

Here’s a quick dose: KLIA2 opened in 2014 to replace the old LCCT (Low-Cost Carrier Terminal)and is now the home base for airlines like AirAsia and is one of the biggest purpose-built low-cost terminals in the world!

Yes..so big you can literally walk 2km (I think its more..) inside to get to your boarding gate….so be sure to wear comfy shoes or your best cushioned disco sandals (or bring a scooter?)

Gateway@KLIA2 is connected to the terminal, packed with food, stores & even a grocery! It’s like a mini shopping mall with gates, to the extent you could arrive with just credit and dress up from top to bottom complete with rolling luggage to rock the day.

Flying via KLIA2 makes you an early bird even if you are a marathon runner (kudos to you if you have pre-checked in and zero check in luggage). Get there at least 3 hours early—immigration lines can be sneaky long… or check into the many aerohotels or capsule hotels (sama-sama) for a place to crash.

Enjoy the lounge or play the Malaysian “national sport”and explore vast culinary from nasi lemak to homeland FuiYoh uncle Roger’s fried rice and delicate steamed dumplings from din tai fung or A&W and McDonalds, doze on a massage chair or people watch till you daze if you have plenty of time to kill.

Currency exchanges are all around (RHB’s rate is not bad)

KLIA Ekspres from KL Sentral gets you there fast & comfy.

E-hailing is a buzz with tonnes of queues at level 1

Whether you’re heading off to new adventures or coming home to Nasi Lemak, KLIA2’s got your back.",Positive
Good & Friendly staff...,Positive
"This was my very first time flying through an international terminal, and KLIA truly made it special. The airport is clean, spacious, and well-organized. Signage is clear, and immigration & security processes were smooth and efficient. There are plenty of food and shopping options, and the atmosphere feels modern yet calming. I especially appreciated how helpful and friendly the airport staff were.
Hope to be back here soon for another journey!",Positive
"Modern, well-connected, and spacious international airport

Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is one of Southeast Asia’s most impressive airports. It’s clean, well-organized, and offers plenty of services for both international and domestic travelers. The airport is split into two terminals: KLIA (main terminal) for full-service airlines and KLIA2 for budget carriers like AirAsia. A free shuttle bus runs between them frequently, which is super convenient.

The main terminal (KLIA) is spacious with high ceilings and even includes a small indoor rainforest—a really unique touch! Immigration and customs can be slow during peak hours, but the staff are generally friendly and helpful. Signage throughout the airport is clear, and it’s easy to find your way around.

KLIA2 is more modern in terms of retail options, offering a wide variety of shops, restaurants, and lounges. It has more of a shopping mall feel and is perfect if you have a long layover. However, walking distances can be long, so plan accordingly.

The KLIA Ekspres train makes travel to and from downtown Kuala Lumpur quick and easy (about 30 minutes), which is a major plus.

Some downsides include occasional delays at immigration and certain gates that require shuttle buses, which isn’t ideal for tired travelers. Still, overall, KLIA is a great airport—efficient, comfortable, and a solid first impression of Malaysia.",Positive
"Very nice airport, I like it.",Positive
"LCC主体のターミナル2（KLIA2）を利用しました。
到着口を出たところに飲食店がたくさんあり、24時間営業の店も多数あるのがとても良いです。充電できる座席は多数あり、Wifiの飛んでいる店舗もあります。
到着口を出てやや左手奥にあるフードコートは価格がかなり安いです。
JayaGROCERというスーパーマーケットも安い。

到着したら、市街地までの移動はKLIAエクスプレスという特急列車が安くて早い。ただし出発時刻に制限があるため、楽に移動したいなら配車サービスの「Grab」かタクシーなどを利用しましょう。
なお最安は圧倒的にバスです。

搭乗口のあるLEVEL3の向かって左手奥にはプライオリティパス対応の高級感あるラウンジもあります（3時間制）。
夜の搭乗口フロアには地面で寝ている人もちょこちょこ見かけました。

ただ難点としては、搭乗ゲートに向かうまでの距離がとてもとても長い点です。
最初の簡易荷物検査を受けてからゲートまでは待ち時間ゼロでも20分ほど歩きます。",Positive

"Review: Kuala Lumpur International Airport – Smooth & Convenient

KLIA is one of the better airports in Southeast Asia, offering a smooth travel experience.

What’s Good:

✅ Easy Immigration & Security – The process is quick and hassle-free.
✅ Duty-Free Shopping – Plenty of options for souvenirs, electronics, and luxury items.
✅ Food Choices – A good variety of restaurants and cafés to choose from.

Final Verdict:

A well-managed airport with efficient services and good shopping and dining options. Whether you’re on a layover or flying out, KLIA makes travel easy.",Positive
"It's quite good, very clean, with international standards, the road markings are quite complex and narrow, so you have to be careful.",Positive

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is a well-designed and efficient airport that offers a pleasant travel experience. The infrastructure is modern, clean, and easy to navigate, with clear signage in multiple languages and helpful staff at most points. The airport is spacious and rarely feels overcrowded, even during peak hours. Immigration and security procedures are generally smooth and well-organized.

There are decent food courts, duty-free shops, and lounges, and the airport is well-connected with public transport options like the KLIA Ekspres train, buses, and Grab services. Clean washrooms and comfortable waiting areas also contribute to a positive experience.

However, compared to major international airports in more developed countries like Singapore’s Changi or Dubai International, KLIA still falls short in terms of variety and scale of shopping, entertainment, and dining options. While it covers the basics well, there’s limited innovation or unique features that stand out globally. Transit experience, especially during late hours, can feel a bit dull due to reduced services.

Overall, KLIA is a solid international airport that serves its purpose well, especially for regional travel, but there is room to enhance its offerings and compete with the world’s leading hubs.",Positive
Nice airport...,Positive
There are two terminals. Food and beverage prices are not high. You can take a bus to the city for 16 RM; it goes to KL Sentral.,Positive

"Magnificent, wooded, well-equipped and the train for the transfer magnificent. But what I find a shame is at the customs level for foreigners, be patient, at least 45 to more than an hour of waiting in the queue before going through the formalities to enter the territory. Courage",Positive

"My sincere gratitude to the KLIA airport screening team for your outstanding assistance in helping me to recover my lost watch! The entire incident happened at the last screening section before the boarding gate C26 while I was boarding my flight (PR 8526) back to Manila on 1st May 2025. I put my watch in an empty tray for sreening, however, I forgot to collect my watch after the screening. After about 15 minutes at the boarding area, that was when I noticed I had not collected my watch, I approached the screening staff.

The staff didn't take my concern in a perfunctory manner but in fact patiently asked me about the physical design of my watch and what time I put my watch for screening. More than 4 staff really hunted high and low, left no stone unturned at the entire screening area to recover my lost watch.The staff also immediately coordinated with surveillance team, however, without any optimistic results of my lost watch, I had to board the aircraft without any further delay as the boarding gate was about to close. The staff then got my mobile number and email address. When I didn't hold out much hope on that, the airport staff handed my watch to me at my seat.

Dear KLIA team, your swift action, professionalism, teamwork, and dedication to passengers care truly stood out and made a stressful experience to a posive one! Sorry guys that time was too rush and didn't get a chance to get the names of you all. Hope to get your names to compliment you all to your management. Please continue to give your best to make Malaysia airports reputable one! Malaysia is proud of you guys!!!!",Positive

I arrived using Air Asia to go to Bali. Immigration was smooth.,Positive
"KLIA is a big, modern, and easy airport to use. It has clean toilets, clear signs, and friendly staff. There are many restaurants and shops to choose from. Transport to the city is easy.

So happy that they've got mussallas,Positive
Another giga shopping mall where you don't know where to go...super fast immigration and slow customs...overall good !,Positive
"Kuala Lumpur International Airport is huge — so big you sometimes wonder if your gate is in a different time zone. Luckily, the trains between terminals make life easier, and once you get there, the facilities are solid: plenty of shops, food, and lounges to keep you busy. Immigration can be a test of patience, but overall it’s efficient and well organized. A modern airport that does its job — just wear comfy shoes for the walks!",Positive
"Overall, my experience at KLIA was very positive. Immigration was smooth and the departure area was clean and very huge. I used the airport for both a transit and a later departure and found the facilities to be well maintained. The only area for improvement would be the signage, which could be better for easier navigation.",Positive
The airport is spacious and the facilities are very adequate.,Positive
Super but Busy international airport,Positive
"It's a large airport. Many shops are open even in the early morning. The smoking area in C10 is open from 7am, so the second floor of C31 is open, which is better, but it's very smoky.",Positive
"After my recent experience at Nice and CDG airports (in France), I'm continuing my chronicle of everything a traveler has to go through! And what a joy to arrive at Kuala Lumpur airport 😀 Here everything is practical, easy, and when you don't know, there's someone to help you. The service is great for going through immigration, and then for the suitcases, they help you collect them and place them on a trolley. In addition, the travel bags arrive in a plastic basket so as not to damage them! You are still helped for customs control, and the exit is convenient with the ""Grab"" application or the KLIA express. Thank you for managing this (very clean) welcoming airport 😀",Positive
"Very people friendly, organized and calming",Positive

"I was in transit through KLIA Terminal 1 and had a very smooth experience. The airport is spacious, clean, and well organized, with clear signs that make it easy to move around. For long gates, there is a train facility connecting buildings, which makes reaching your gate quick and convenient.

There’s a nice park for kids to play and enjoy, which is perfect for families during layovers. I was also impressed by the variety of food options – plenty of vegetarian and non-vegetarian restaurants to choose from. The lounges and seating areas are comfortable, and the staff were friendly and helpful.

However, it is a little cheaper to buy a round trip ticket.

It takes about 40 minutes, so it's very quick.
1.5 hours by bus (considering traffic jams)
About 500 yen",Positive
Lovely airport.,Positive
"If you are looking for the capital airport of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur International Airport, this is definitely the one for you. It is big and spacious.
It is a little far from the city, so please be careful when traveling.
And don't make a mistake.
It takes quite a while to get to the city.

They use the windows well, and blend in well with nature.
The facilities are also substantial, so you won't get bored even if you come a little early.
If you don't arrive two hours before an international flight, you won't be able to deal with any sudden problems.
I tend to be lazy and think, ""I can play a little more after that, right?!"", but if you consider the cost and time lost when you don't fly, it's better to go early.
There are two airports in Kuala Lumpur, but the one in the city is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport. It does have international flights, but it only covers a very limited area.
In terms of image, it's in a position similar to Osaka Itami Airport.
It is unbeatable in terms of convenience, and if you live in the capital, this is definitely the best choice. It was a good idea to build a larger airport because it had become too small, but demolishing it would cause other problems, so they decided to leave it as it is.",Positive
"It's a big transfer. It's really far away from the city, but it's okay. It's good to have express trains.",Positive
"Big airport, was a bit difficult to find the right gate, but eventually we succeeded.",Positive
"- Pros: diverse goods, food and beverage prices are not too high compared to other international airports.

+ Quick immigration procedures
- Cons: few toilets + toilets are clogged, women's toilets have to wait in line
+ The process of checking luggage twice is a bit time-consuming for passengers.

There are processes of repair, renovation and other upgrade projects from time to time to ensure that this airport can operate properly.",Positive
"What a nice baby care room! There were not only a baby bed, individual breastfeeding rooms, a washbasin, multipurpose bathroom, but also toys for babies like a photo attached.
It was located before immigration check in. Near the counter H at terminal 1.",Positive
Well maintained and nice airport,Positive
Klia 2 is good. Have a good service and most of it are self service so we have to be ready and equipped ourselves with knowledge i think. They also got many restaurants and shops to eat and shop here!,Positive
"Good airport, with compelte facilites(toilets, praying room, smoking room, nursery room, imigration, luggage/baggage area, check in, and other areas) It also has quite a stunning view of planes taking off/landing if you're in the right. Quite a lot of stores to visit(prices are quite expensive because it's in an airport). However, sadly almost got scammed by one of the van dribers at night. Went here twice, really enjoyed my wait there, the temp was cool and the airport is modern with clean toilets, 4,3/5. Would come back again",Positive
"It's so spacious! I used a bus when I arrived on an ANA flight from Narita, and also took a bus to the ANA gate on my way back.
There is a status lounge just one floor above the ANA departure gate, so I killed time there with a light meal and coffee before boarding the plane.",Positive
Very good.. lots of shops.. like in a shopping mall,Positive
Pleasure,Positive
"The airport is well-maintained and there are many famous shops in the airport, so it is good for shopping, but it seems more expensive than outside. There are many convenience stores and restaurants outside, so there are many things to eat. Cafes like Starbucks are open early in the morning. Just keep in mind that there are many cars in the airport when boarding a vehicle, so it is crowded.",Positive
Nice and cute airport...,Positive
Very neat and clean attentive,Positive
"It was my first time at Kuala Lumpur Airport. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to stroll around. However, the immigration process was quite convenient and quick, and the shops in the airport were also very attractive. I hope I can arrange some time to stroll around in the future.",Positive

The transfer gate was right in front of me.
I had a 4 hour layover so I spent the time in the Priority Pass lounge.
It was a good way to kill time.",Positive
"Clean, neat, organized and complete with a food court.",Positive
"Spread across large area. Malaysia welcomes one with Palm Tree views as we land. They have lot of shopping options. Service at the baggage belt is also good. Immigration often has a big queue and is time consuming.

But to find the C gates at the international terminal is confusing as they have multiple directions.",Positive
"KLIA, a symbol of Malaysian pride, is the main gateway to the homeland that combines the beauty of modern architecture and elements of local culture. With its elegant and state-of-the-art design, KLIA is not just an airport, but a mesmerizing first experience for tourists.

For those who love to shop, the ""world without borders"" at KLIA offers a variety of international and local brands. That's not enough, the row of restaurants serves a variety of dishes, from traditional Malaysian cuisine to international food.

Friendly customer service and well-equipped facilities such as fast internet connection, comfortable lounges, and efficient public transportation make travel smoother and more enjoyable.

KLIA is not just a transit destination, it is a symbol of Malaysian hospitality that welcomes the world with open arms. Every corner is like a reflection of the nation's aspirations and progress.",Positive

"it was very nice
There are a lot of food shops and parfume and souvenir shops",Positive
Good for transfer waiting,Positive
"Already the time to go back. International Arrivals terminal is very nice, BUT we cannot buy cigarettes at the duty free since the law in Malaysia is different : you have to pay taxes here.

But you can buy we you go back, at the Departures, after the immigration.

There's a lot of shops, restaurants and room to smoke cigarettes after the immigration. At the departures it can be hard to find, but it exist (at the domestic terminal, which is challenging since there is a bus to catch to go and come back (15 + 15 minutes to plan, be smart because it can be stressful).

Immigration services at the arrivals and at the departures are up to date, very efficient and staff is smiling, helping, caring and welcoming.",Positive

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) offers a seamless and enjoyable travel experience, blending modern facilities with cultural touches that reflect Malaysia's rich heritage. Upon arrival, the airport's spacious and well-organized layout ensures smooth navigation, with clear signage in both English and Malay. The immigration process is efficient, though queues can occasionally be longer during peak hours. The baggage claim area is well-maintained, and luggage arrives promptly. KLIA's architecture is impressive, featuring a blend of contemporary design and traditional Malaysian elements, such as the iconic ""forest"" theme in the Satellite Building, which creates a calming atmosphere. The airport is equipped with a wide range of amenities, including numerous dining options that cater to various tastes, from local delicacies like nasi lemak to international cuisine. Duty-free shopping is a highlight, offering a variety of products at competitive prices. For travelers with layovers, the airport provides comfortable lounges, free Wi-Fi, and even a hotel within the terminal for longer stays. The staff are generally friendly and helpful, enhancing the overall experience. However, the airport's size can be overwhelming for first-time visitors, and the walking distances between gates can be tiring. Transportation options to the city center are plentiful, with the KLIA Express train being the fastest and most convenient choice. Overall, KLIA stands out as a world-class airport, combining efficiency, comfort, and a touch of Malaysian culture, making it a pleasant gateway for both domestic and international travelers.",Positive
"It was an awesome international airport.

The place is definitely vast and huge as even though there are tons and tons of people it is still utterly quiet.

Know where and which floor you are going because it is easy to get lost inn here.

Flights are coming in and out from and to other international and local airports.

Definitely one of the pride of all Malaysians as it is a unique point of entry to the country.

Welcome to Malaysia to the visitors and Malaysia tanah air ku to the locals 💖",Positive

"KLIA is a pretty solid airport! There are tons of shops to browse through and plenty of food options if you’re feeling hungry—everything from local snacks to international bites. It definitely makes layovers or early check-ins way more enjoyable.

"It is quite an international airport, and the procedures are not the same as those in Taiwan.
The venue is spacious and separates regular flights from low-cost airlines. It is also worthy of praise.",Positive

Very stress free connection. Used the Golden Lounge twice. Very good meal service.,Positive
"If you are looking for the capital airport of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur International Airport, this is definitely the one for you. It is big and spacious.
It is a little far from the city, so please be careful when traveling.
And don't make a mistake.
It takes quite a while to get to the city.

They use the windows well, and blend in well with nature.
The facilities are also substantial, so you won't get bored even if you come a little early.
If you don't arrive two hours before an international flight, you won't be able to deal with any sudden problems.
I tend to be lazy and think, ""I can play a little more after that, right?!"", but if you consider the cost and time lost when you don't fly, it's better to go early.
There are two airports in Kuala Lumpur, but the one in the city is Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport. It does have international flights, but it only covers a very limited area.
In terms of image, it's in a position similar to Osaka Itami Airport.
It is unbeatable in terms of convenience, and if you live in the capital, this is definitely the best choice. It was a good idea to build a larger airport because it had become too small, but demolishing it would cause other problems, so they decided to leave it as it is.",Positive
"Very good Airport.  If you're picking up someone, ask them to meet you at door 8 because you can park your car there in the pickup lane and walk to meet them at the door. At other doors there's a limit of 3 minutes and they won't allow you to leave the car.",Positive

A number of shops for last minute buys. No frills and reasonably clean.

"✈️ Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) – A Major Asian Hub with Smooth Connectivity | Travel Consultant Review

As a travel consultant, I often recommend KLIA as a transit point or entry to Southeast Asia. Here's a breakdown of the experience:

🌟 Highlights:
✅ Modern Infrastructure
KLIA is clean, spacious, and well-designed. The terminals—KLIA (Main Terminal) and KLIA2 (Low-cost Terminal)—are efficiently connected via train and shuttle.

✅ Connectivity
Excellent connectivity via ERL (Express Rail Link) to central Kuala Lumpur in just ~30 minutes. Clear signage in English and Malay makes navigation easy for international travelers.

✅ Immigration & Security
Immigration can be quick during non-peak hours, but delays are possible during busy times. Security is generally smooth and well-organized.

✅ Shopping & Amenities
KLIA offers duty-free shops, premium brands, local crafts, and great food courts. Muslim prayer rooms, child play areas, lounges, and clean restrooms add to the comfort.

✅ Hospitality & Help Desks
Friendly and professional staff. Help counters and digital info kiosks are helpful, especially for first-time visitors.

⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind:
KLIA2 is separate and caters mostly to AirAsia and budget carriers—plan accordingly if you have a connecting flight between KLIA and KLIA2.

Transit times between gates can be long; allow extra time, especially for international connections.

🧳 Consultant’s Tip:
Use the Plaza Premium Lounge for long layovers—it’s affordable and well-equipped. Download the Malaysia Airports app for real-time updates and gate information.

Overall Rating: 8.5/10
A world-class airport that balances efficiency with Malaysian hospitality—ideal for smooth international transit or as a gateway to explore Malaysia.",Positive

"AMAZING AIRPORT.. VERY INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL . WARM WELCOMING BY THE IMMIGRATION AND THE POLICE ...

THANK YOU
JASON",Positive
There are 3 levels of food to have your fill.,Positive
"My experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was generally very positive. The airport is modern, spacious, and well-organized. However, during arrival, there was a bit of confusion at the passport control stage. The signage wasn’t very clear, especially when it came to directing passengers with foreign passports versus those with Malaysian ones — they go through different gates.

Additionally, all visitors are required to fill out a form regarding their stay in Malaysia. Thankfully, there are enough computers to do this at the airport ( you can do it on your device), but the process can take a little time. It requires having all your accommodation details ready, including the full address, which isn’t always at your fingertips after a long flight. The form could definitely be a bit more user-friendly.

On the other hand, the departure process was fantastic — quick, smooth, and with no queues at all. It was honestly one of the most stress-free airport departures I've ever experienced. The airport wasn’t overcrowded, which made everything feel relaxed and efficient.

All in all, KLIA delivers a pleasant travel experience, especially if you’re well-prepared on arrival. I'd definitely be happy to fly through here again!",Positive
V good experience here need nd clear palace. Helpful staff,Positive
"A very beautiful and large airport with more than one building for travel. All buildings have markets, shops and restaurants. The internet is fast and without email registration and nonsense.",Positive
"It's so spacious! I used a bus when I arrived on an ANA flight from Narita, and also took a bus to the ANA gate on my way back.
There is a status lounge just one floor above the ANA departure gate, so I killed time there with a light meal and coffee before boarding the plane.",Positive
"This airport is very crowded. The place is spacious and clean. The service of the officers is fast, although there are some small individuals who are not very friendly. There are many choices of food menus in the food court and shopping counters. There are also several lodgings in the airport. We can use the luggage trolleys at the airport for free.",Positive
"KLIA is a big, modern, and easy airport to use. It has clean toilets, clear signs, and friendly staff. There are many restaurants and shops to choose from. Transport to the city is easy. Some areas look a bit old, and immigration or changing terminals can take time. But overall, it’s a good airport for all kinds of travelers.",Positive
Very good and convenient. The lady cleaner near H4 stopped my mom to wash her feet for ablution though. The train os fast and everything.,Positive
"Upon arrival, I felt like I was in an African country's airport, but upon departure, their new airport was beautiful, tidy, and clean.",Positive
This is the best airport in Malaysia,Positive
"1. The structure is unique.

2. The structure where entry and exit meet at the duty-free shop.

3. Because of this, security checks are done in front of the gate.

4. The duty-free shop sells various things, but there is no price merit.

5. There are many cafes such as Starbucks and Coffee Bean and places to eat light meals.

6. There is a smoking room near C31 in Terminal 1. It is not very ventilated.

7. The smoking room in C11 is less crowded and more comfortable.

8. The Korean Air counter is close to K. Exit 8.

9. There is almost no goods at the Starbucks near the Korean Air boarding area.

10. The Starbucks in the boarding area before the bus ride has a lot of goods.",Positive
"Very modern and clean, everything is automated.",Positive

"Having travelled to many international airports, I have to say KLIA is one of the better ones. It's not jam packed, staff are professional and services at par with international airports elsewhere.

Oh the immigration clearance is by far the best experience.

😁",Positive
There are many famous restaurants from around the world. You need to register to use the Wi-Fi. Malaysians are very friendly when you tell them you're Japanese. I think Japanese people need to be more aware of the reality of how much they appreciate us. We are grateful to our Japanese ancestors who protected Asia from the Western powers. 2025.8/12,Positive
"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) is one of the most well-organized and clean airports I’ve experienced in Southeast Asia. The moment you land, the airport greets you with a sense of calm, spacious design, and a touch of Malaysian hospitality. I arrived via an international flight at KLIA Terminal 1, and the immigration process was smooth and efficient, with polite officers and clear signage everywhere.

The airport is modern and beautifully maintained, with plenty of seating areas, clean washrooms, and good connectivity to the city via the KLIA Ekspres train. It took me just under 30 minutes to reach KL Sentral, which was incredibly convenient. The shopping and dining options are diverse—from local Malaysian snacks to international chains and luxury brands.

My only issue was the aerotrain between the main terminal and the satellite building being out of service, which meant taking shuttle buses instead. Also, baggage claim took a bit longer than expected. Despite that, the overall experience was pleasant.

KLIA2, which I visited on a previous trip, was a bit more chaotic due to the budget airline crowd, but still fairly efficient.

Overall, KLIA is a great international hub, well worth 4 stars, and I’d happily fly through here again",Positive

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport is Malaysia’s flagship gateway—modern, spacious, and well‑equipped, though not without its quirks. Terminal 1 (KLIA) features soaring ceilings, large glass facades, and even an indoor rainforest—all wrapped in a clean, bright environment. Check-in, immigration, and security are generally smooth, helped by self‑service kiosks and frequent KLIA Ekspres trains and buses. But there is something that needs to get mentioned, one is the longer immigration lines with huge crowd and not much welcome immigration officers and 2nd is the layout confusion about terminal 1 and 2. Overall experience was pleasant.",Positive

"For being one of the largest airports with very heavy traffic, I was surprised when I arrived, you register your Nmcd, I think it is the online registration of the passport date at the airport itself, then you go through the physical control of your passport or the scanned control of your passport... I chose the second and it was super fast, I scanned my passport, the little door opened and in the hallway there was a camera and it took a photo of me and I went straight to get my suitcase without queues or nonsense. In addition, I lost the check-boarding document and they asked me for it, which made me happy because in Bangkok I lost it and what a hassle they gave me at customs.",Positive

"Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) – Quick Review

KLIA is one of Southeast Asia’s busiest and most modern airports, offering a smooth and efficient travel experience.

What’s Great:

Clean, spacious, and well-organized terminals (KLIA1 for full-service airlines, KLIA2 for budget carriers like AirAsia).

Immigration and baggage handling are generally fast and well-managed.

Excellent connectivity to the city via the KLIA Ekspres train (30 mins to KL Sentral).

Plenty of dining options, duty-free shopping, and comfortable lounges.

Free Wi-Fi that actually works well.

What Could Be Better:

KLIA2 can feel a bit chaotic and crowded during peak hours.

Transit between KLIA1 and KLIA2 can take ~10–15 minutes via shuttle/train.",Positive

"Arrived here around 3am and I was amazed because of the hassle-free queueing and not much documents needed but also very secured and organized, the airport seemed to be abandoned but in reality every transaction is really fast. We have to present the MDAC to the officer and I had it finished before my flight.",Positive

"KLIA (Kula Lumpur International AirPort) Terminal 1 is a well-designed, modern airport with spacious interiors, smooth immigration, and a good mix of dining and shopping options. The architecture is impressive, and premium lounges offer a relaxing experience for long layovers.

However, the Aerotrain is currently down, so shuttle buses can cause delays during transfers. Also, limited water dispensers and gate specific security checks can be inconvenient for travelers.

Overall, a clean, efficient, and traveler friendly airport just allow some extra time and keep a water bottle handy!",Positive
It is very nice and has all the facilities ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤩🤩🤩🤩,Positive
Good,Positive
"KLIA really slaps as an airport ✈️✨ Smooth vibes from the moment you land — clear signs, easy flow, and that iconic design with natural light flooding in.

Shops, lounges, eats… everything feels premium yet chill. Plus, KLIA Ekspres gets you to the city in no time 🚄. Honestly, one of the most underrated hubs in Asia — efficient and aesthetic.",Positive
pleasant,Positive
Jungle within the jungle. You can spend time exploring while waiting for boarding. Exclusive transportation for MAS Platinum members and those flying Business or First Class. Myboarderpass works perfectly.,Positive
Very nice and super convenient for tourists. It's open 24/7,Positive
"Do plan ahead of time as there are 2 rounds of baggage screening. There are plenty of food options at the airport mall, near departure area and inside the transit area.

You can refill water outside of the toilets after you pass the 2nd baggage screening.

For arrival, I found myself walking a lot just to get to the baggage collection area. Easily a 10 mins walk.",Positive
Vegetarian have limited options….the airport is big and sorted,Positive
Clean and well managed airport . Enough food counter and other shopping counter available.  Helpful staff 👌,Positive
"Flying out or landing in KLIA2?

Here’s a quick dose: KLIA2 opened in 2014 to replace the old LCCT (Low-Cost Carrier Terminal)and is now the home base for airlines like AirAsia and is one of the biggest purpose-built low-cost terminals in the world!

Yes..so big you can literally walk 2km (I think its more..) inside to get to your boarding gate….so be sure to wear comfy shoes or your best cushioned disco sandals (or bring a scooter?)

Gateway@KLIA2 is connected to the terminal, packed with food, stores & even a grocery! It’s like a mini shopping mall with gates, to the extent you could arrive with just credit and dress up from top to bottom complete with rolling luggage to rock the day.

Flying via KLIA2 makes you an early bird even if you are a marathon runner (kudos to you if you have pre-checked in and zero check in luggage). Get there at least 3 hours early—immigration lines can be sneaky long… or check into the many aerohotels or capsule hotels (sama-sama) for a place to crash.

Enjoy the lounge or play the Malaysian “national sport”and explore vast culinary from nasi lemak to homeland FuiYoh uncle Roger’s fried rice and delicate steamed dumplings from din tai fung or A&W and McDonalds, doze on a massage chair or people watch till you daze if you have plenty of time to kill.

Currency exchanges are all around (RHB’s rate is not bad)

KLIA Ekspres from KL Sentral gets you there fast & comfy.

E-hailing is a buzz with tonnes of queues at level 1

Whether you’re heading off to new adventures or coming home to Nasi Lemak, KLIA2’s got your back.",Positive
Super,Positive
"The airport is modern, clean, and well-equipped with lots of shops and dining options. It looks great and feels spacious. However, the layout can be a little confusing at times — especially when transferring between terminals or figuring out immigration and baggage.

Still, staff are helpful and things generally run smoothly. Once you get the hang of it, it’s a pretty solid airport!",Positive
Good management,Positive
