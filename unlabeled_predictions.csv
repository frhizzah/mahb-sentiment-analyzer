Terrible signage. Rudest staff ever and immigration takes one hour.
Huge queues.

"One of the most messy experience in my life. Seems like everything manages on the go - they changed the gate, staff wasn't aware about flights and gates, said me go to a wrong gate, I wasted my time standing in a wrong line (and passing xray control in transit zone). Then staff for several minutes tried to check my passport and flight to understand that it's not my gate.

And the last straw - I came back here again and they ask for applying online arrival form. And if you haven't done it in advance you have to pay for a ""rush mode"" almost $100, I think it's fair to call it ""scam"". I'll try to avoid this airport in future, total disappointment",Negative,92.46%

"Your airport is the worst I've ever been to, everyone there doesn't have a smile. You are rude it was my dream to come to Malaysia but just upon arrival at the airport. I will never set foot in your country again.
We ask for directions, we are quickly answered with a haughty air and we never understand the answer. Frankly, I advise you against it. The food in the airport is disgusting.",Negative,88.60%
"The airport in Klia is quite big and the place is also nice, but unfortunately the airport staff are not friendly and not very informative (perhaps they are deliberately juggling so they don't get asked too many questions x yes) and in my opinion there is a lack of manpower... Because if I want to ask the officer... It's very difficult
At that time, I came from Jakarta and transited at KLIA to another country. When I got out of the plane, I just followed the procession to a certain place and it turned out that at that time we happened to appear near the food court area, in this place there weren't too many food stalls open but there were quite a few. choice of food type
At that time we tried several places with a menu of fried noodles, Hainanese rice, briyani rice and fried chicken
Of all the restaurants above, the winner is fried noodles, the taste is delicious to the Indonesian tongue, kyuuu, even the prices are cheaper compared to other restaurants.
And the worst thing is fried chicken, the fried chicken packages here are sold not with rice but some kind of cake (?) But it turns out they sell rice too and regret buying rice, apart from being expensive it turns out it's not worth eating, because the rice is already dry (what kind of rice is this? rengginang, right?) And the chicken is also a little dry, so when we come here we always avoid Malaysian fried chicken because that's how it is deeeh
BTW (talking in a whisper) even the sellers are also rude, loohhh... They are not friendly...",Negative,63.29%

I showed him my smartphone, which had a translation app on it, but the moment he saw the Japanese words, he violently threw the smartphone away. It was the first time in my life that I had been treated so cruelly. Malaysia Airlines flight to Changi International Airport on August 15, 2024 at 07:50. A Muslim woman wearing glasses. It was a really terrible response. I'll say it again. I don't want to go there again.",Negative,96.77%
"One of the worst airports in the world. Least tourist friendly in Southeast Asia. When it comes to transportation out of the airport, it’s simply a chaos. What’s the airport management thinking, designing the car park on Level 1, Door 5 that way. Go there at 7pm and it’s so chaotic, third world style traffic management. If you want to run an airport efficiently, send a delegation to your next door, which happens to run the best airport in the world.",Positive,74.64%
Im pregnant so me and my family lined up at the pregnant/pwd section at the immigration. This woman told my husband and 2 little boys to go to regular line. So i end up going ahead of them and picking up all our bags. DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME! Pure stupidity!

"My experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was extremely frustrating and stressful. The layout of the airport is confusing, and this leads to unnecessary stress and a lot of wasted time. Be prepared for an unreasonable amount of walking—you might even need to take multiple buses and trains just to get where you need to go.

The staff are untrained and unprofessional. The food selection is poor, and on top of that, the service is both bad and incredibly slow. I had to follow up several times just to get my order. The toilets are dirty, and it's not uncommon for there to be no toilet paper.

Avoid KL and choose Singapore whenever possible

The connection between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 is not well-marked, and worse, it isn’t even free. If you're traveling across the Asia-Pacific region and have the option to go through Singapore, do it. I decided to try KL because I liked the AirAsia business class option, which I admit is great, but the entire experience was ruined by the chaos of KLIA. If you want a better experience, go for ScootPlus. It may not be quite as luxurious as AirAsia business class, but it’s almost as good, and the experience is far better overall thanks to Singapore Changi International Airport.",Negative,85.77%
"Small tray for domestic flights during x ray , also coming from europe to domestic, i didn't know we need to take out our phones out , in europe the machine scans everything,  also toilets in klia are not clean .

"one of the good airports, clean, comfortable and complete facilities. There is a free shuttle bus to other terminals. The only drawback is that IMMIGRATION is very SLOW and not nice.

1. At gate H2 today around 16.00. Those persons who are in charge, confiscate my
1. drinking water, which I need for taking my tablet.
2. Shampoo, soap and lotion

said it is regulation.
Said the airline prohibited anything over 150 ML carry inside cabin.Told them, I never had problem before. Never used luggage.

But, when I took video, they were panic and insisting me to delete it. Especially since I answered them I will file a complain.
Why they have to panic?
CCTV can proofed it
Funny thing, this one lady, yelling to me asking for my boarding pass and passport, took picture of those.

I mention, my last trip to KL.was okay, she said all malaysian airline are not allowing.
And right before I left, she was making sure if I am not filling a complain again 'just doing what they had to' .

So, is this mean, airline prohibited and still selling the water during the flight?
Or, the airport prohibited?

There was also another passenger who carried used perfume with very small amout left in 250 ML bottle. Also took away... so is this about the size or the amount?

There are no signs and it is like a maze. Fortunately, we were guided by a Chinese-speaking girl before we walked out.

"Never ever Use this Malaysia airline for our travel... We regret for that sure.......

I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the customer service I received at the check-in counter during my recent flight with Malaysia airlines on MH0109 from COK to MEL on 15th October 2024.

Upon arrival at the check-in counter, I experienced significant delays due to the disorganized and overwhelmed staff. Despite arriving well in advance, I had to wait for an extended period, which caused unnecessary stress and inconvenience.

During check-in, my personal electronic devices (laptop and tablet) were included in the calculation of my baggage weight, resulting in additional charges. Unfortunately, my main baggage had already been processed, leaving me no opportunity to adjust its contents.

Despite having only 1 kg of excess weight, I was forced to dispose of some personal items to comply with the weight limit. I find it unfair and unjustified that personal electronic devices, typically considered essential carry-on items, were treated as checked baggage.

Furthermore, while at the payment counter, a senior staff member, who appeared to be a supervisor, inquired about the sales target for the day by asking ""How much is the sale amount"". This interaction left me with the impression that the airline's policy is to reduce the airfare and then force passengers to pay for petty baggage differences at the airport. This practice is both misleading and exploitative.

The manner in which this situation was handled by your staff was unprofessional and lacked empathy. Despite my attempts to explain the situation, I was met with indifference and a lack of willingness to assist. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied with the level of service provided by Malaysia airlines.",Negative,92.23%
"I have traveled a lot and been to many airports, but like the wait that happened to me at Malaysian passports, waiting for more than two hours at the passport control has become something abnormal, and there are only three employees stamping for a huge number of passengers.
