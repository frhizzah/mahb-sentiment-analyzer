"One of the most messy experience in my life. Seems like everything manages on the go - they changed the gate, staff wasn't aware about flights and gates, said me go to a wrong gate, I wasted my time standing in a wrong line (and passing xray control in transit zone). Then staff for several minutes tried to check my passport and flight to understand that it's not my gate.

And the last straw - I came back here again and they ask for applying online arrival form. And if you haven't done it in advance you have to pay for a ""rush mode"" almost $100, I think it's fair to call it ""scam"". I'll try to avoid this airport in future, total disappointment",one messy experience life seem like everything manages go change wasnt aware flight gate say go wrong waste time stand wrong line pass xray control transit zone several minute try check passport understand last straw come back ask apply online form havent do advance pay rush mode almost 100 think fair call scam ill try avoid future total disappointment,Negative,88.48004324169378

"The airport in Klia is quite big and the place is also nice, but unfortunately the airport staff are not friendly and not very informative (perhaps they are deliberately juggling so they don't get asked too many questions x yes) and in my opinion there is a lack of manpower... Because if I want to ask the officer... It's very difficult
At that time, I came from Jakarta and transited at KLIA to another country. When I got out of the plane, I just followed the procession to a certain place and it turned out that at that time we happened to appear near the food court area, in this place there weren't too many food stalls open but there were quite a few. choice of food type
At that time we tried several places with a menu of fried noodles, Hainanese rice, briyani rice and fried chicken
Of all the restaurants above, the winner is fried noodles, the taste is delicious to the Indonesian tongue, kyuuu, even the prices are cheaper compared to other restaurants.
And the worst thing is fried chicken, the fried chicken packages here are sold not with rice but some kind of cake (?) But it turns out they sell rice too and regret buying rice, apart from being expensive it turns out it's not worth eating, because the rice is already dry (what kind of rice is this? rengginang, right?) And the chicken is also a little dry, so when we come here we always avoid Malaysian fried chicken because that's how it is deeeh

"My experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) was extremely frustrating and stressful. The layout of the airport is confusing, and this leads to unnecessary stress and a lot of wasted time. Be prepared for an unreasonable amount of walking—you might even need to take multiple buses and trains just to get where you need to go.

The staff are untrained and unprofessional. The food selection is poor, and on top of that, the service is both bad and incredibly slow. I had to follow up several times just to get my order. The toilets are dirty, and it's not uncommon for there to be no toilet paper.

Avoid KL and choose Singapore whenever possible

The connection between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 is not well-marked, and worse, it isn’t even free. If you're traveling across the Asia-Pacific region and have the option to go through Singapore, do it. I decided to try KL because I liked the AirAsia business class option, which I admit is great, but the entire experience was ruined by the chaos of KLIA. If you want a better experience, go for ScootPlus. It may not be quite as luxurious as AirAsia business class, but it’s almost as good, and the experience is far better overall thanks to Singapore Changi International Airport.",experience kuala lumpur international extremely frustrating stressful layout confuse lead unnecessary stress lot wasted time prepare unreasonable amount walkingyou might even need take multiple bus train get need go untrained unprofessional food selection poor top service bad incredibly slow follow several time get order toilet dirty uncommon toilet paper avoid kl choose singapore whenever possible connection 1 2 wellmarked bad isnt even free youre travel across asiapacific region option go singapore decide try kl like airasia business class option admit great entire experience ruin chaos want good experience go scootplus may quite luxurious airasia business class almost good experience far well overall thanks singapore changi international,Negative,76.89475497706168

I mention, my last trip to KL.was okay, she said all malaysian airline are not allowing.
And right before I left, she was making sure if I am not filling a complain again 'just doing what they had to' .

So, is this mean, airline prohibited and still selling the water during the flight?

"Never ever Use this Malaysia airline for our travel... We regret for that sure.......

I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the customer service I received at the check-in counter during my recent flight with Malaysia airlines on MH0109 from COK to MEL on 15th October 2024.

Upon arrival at the check-in counter, I experienced significant delays due to the disorganized and overwhelmed staff. Despite arriving well in advance, I had to wait for an extended period, which caused unnecessary stress and inconvenience.

During check-in, my personal electronic devices (laptop and tablet) were included in the calculation of my baggage weight, resulting in additional charges. Unfortunately, my main baggage had already been processed, leaving me no opportunity to adjust its contents.

Despite having only 1 kg of excess weight, I was forced to dispose of some personal items to comply with the weight limit. I find it unfair and unjustified that personal electronic devices, typically considered essential carry-on items, were treated as checked baggage.

Furthermore, while at the payment counter, a senior staff member, who appeared to be a supervisor, inquired about the sales target for the day by asking ""How much is the sale amount"". This interaction left me with the impression that the airline's policy is to reduce the airfare and then force passengers to pay for petty baggage differences at the airport. This practice is both misleading and exploitative.

The manner in which this situation was handled by your staff was unprofessional and lacked empathy. Despite my attempts to explain the situation, I was met with indifference and a lack of willingness to assist.

"I recently traveled through Kuala Lumpur International Airport, and I was thoroughly impressed by my experience. The infrastructure is modern and well-maintained, making navigation seamless. The signs are clear, and the layout is intuitive, ensuring that travelers can easily find their way around. Lots of dining options. There are charging stations in front of the gates. Also multiple lounges are available at both the terminals.

One of the standout features was the efficiency of the immigration process. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I moved through immigration. Actually there are multiple counters which helps to avoid long queues in any one counter.

What truly made my visit memorable, however, was the friendliness of the staff. From the check-in counters to the security personnel, everyone I encountered was welcoming and eager to assist whenever I needed some help.",recently travel kuala lumpur international thoroughly impress experience infrastructure modern wellmaintained make navigation seamless sign clear layout intuitive ensure traveler easily find way around lot din option charge station front gate also multiple lounge available terminal one standout feature efficiency process pleasantly surprise quickly move actually multiple counter help avoid long queue one truly make visit memorable however friendliness counter security personnel everyone encounter welcome eager assist whenever need help,Positive,48.15863203093624

"What I love about KLIA is that it's attached to a shopping mall, so when you have a long layover like me, you can exit the airport and do some window shopping for a bit. The food court was pretty good as well, it was still pretty expensive to buy food at the airport but the variety was awesome!

There were plenty of charging areas, I spent a night sleeping at the carpeted floor along with other travelers, so KLIA do a terrific job compare to other airports especially on the ASEAN. (Changi is excluded for a obvious reason)
